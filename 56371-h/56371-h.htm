    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> bright sunny
      morning, at the end of June, in busy, restless London. The overarching
      vault of heaven was filled with an atmosphere of golden hue. Sunshine was
      glowing upon cathedral turrets and upon the church spires, upon the
      pinnacles of lofty buildings, and the crowns of tall factory shafts. The
      bronzed and tarnished ball and cross of St. Paul&rsquo;s, and the shaggy-crested
      Monument, which &ldquo;like a tall bully lifts its head,&rdquo; shone as if they had
      been newly gilded. There was sunshine upon chimney-pots and housetops,
      golden beams permeating the confined air in close garrets, through their
      narrow, half-closed windows; flooding wide streets, and illuminating
      pestiferous courts, where riotous hilarity sometimes, but joy never came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine blazed upon the broad and winding Thames, over whose flowing
      surface lazy barges dawdled, and panting river steamers raced, leaving in
      their sinuous paths myriads of scintillations&mdash;and rather an
      unpleasant odour as well. Sunshine was on the footways, and in the
      roadways, and in the gutters, making mirrors of small muddy pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine there was for the ragged and the richly dressed; for the beggar
      and the prince alike; for the robust and, happily, for the sickly invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine everywhere, making brilliant the parks and open places, and
      interpenetrating all the foulest recesses of this huge city. Giving light
      where it was rarely seen, and rousing to a glad activity the teeming life
      already in its first throes of daily labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful in this, the bright sunshine! but oh, yet more enchanting in the
      glory with which it invested the fair face of a young girl, peering out of
      the upper window of a house situated in one of the City&rsquo;s closest streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there, gazing heavenward, her mild blue eyes bending beneath the
      influence of the golden glare of sunny-waves of light, yet seeming to
      revel in their luxuriance as though they spoke to her in fairy language of
      other and happier times and places now far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the opposite side of the street, in the shop of a working goldsmith,
      one John Harper, there stood a youth, an apprentice to the noble art of
      working in gold. The beauty and the clearness of the fair morning had
      elevated and refreshed his youthful spirits, but ah! how much greater
      their exhilaration when his upturned eyes were gladdened by the sight of
      that beautiful young girl, whose radiant face, and delicately modelled
      form, were brought out in brilliant relief by the dazzling sunbeams.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that his brightest conceptions of the beautiful, his
      dreamy fashionings of a faultless ideal, combined with all his native and
      his acquired skill, had never yet enabled him to realise &ldquo;a thing of
      beauty&rdquo; to rival the perfect excellence and marvellous charms of that
      young face upon which his eager eyes were now fastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raphael, in his rarest art-performance had not in his belief attained the
      sentiment of angelic purity beaming in her features, nor had Carlo Dolci,
      in the loveliest Madonna he ever painted, anticipated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motionless he stood, and with suspended breath gazed upon her as though
      she were one lone bright star, shining unaccompanied in the vast field of
      the deep blue heavens, in the silent night, his mind the while lost in a
      maze of rapture and of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had seen it often for years!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he had a consciousness that a saddening gloom overspread the earth
      far and near. What made the surrounding space in a moment so sombre? Had a
      huge cloud suddenly sprung up from its sullen rest, and spreading itself
      enviously over the broad sky, absorbed the sunlight? Was the sunshine
      which had converted smoky London into a city of golden palaces abruptly
      withdrawn? No! sunbeams yet glanced upon the buildings, and danced upon
      the rippling waters, but the young maiden had disappeared from her window.
      She had suddenly fled from it, as a startled fawn would spring into a
      covert at the sound of the approaching footsteps of a hunter bent upon its
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, though the sunshine was as brilliant as before&mdash;the whole
      universe, in the eyes of Harry Vivian, the young goldsmith, seemed plunged
      into a profound and solemn gloom&mdash;for she was no longer where he yet
      gazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt oppressed in this glittering sunshine, which had no light for him,
      and he drew towards the outer door, that in the free fresh air he might
      breathe more freely. As he gained the threshold, he started, and an
      exclamation of surprise escaped his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite, at the door of the house in which dwelt the young girl upon whom
      his eyes had gazed so fondly, stood a man who in costume and manner was
      the reverse of prepossessing. Who was he, and what could he want there?
      were questions which Harry at once put to himself. He had come on business&mdash;most
      disagreeable business&mdash;that was beyond a doubt, for there was nothing
      either in his garb or in his manner which betrayed the idle visitor.
      Harry, therefore, conceived it to be his especial duty&mdash;with rather
      questionable propriety, however&mdash;to observe his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the man examine the house from the scraper at the door, to the
      parapet below the roof, and then make a peculiar sign to some person or
      persons, who lying <i>perdu</i>, prevented Harry from catching a glimpse
      of them. Then he gave a treble knock at the door, facing which he was
      standing. Young Vivian did not like that knock. It was not a peal of three
      distinct knocks for a third-floor lodger, nor was it the easy rat-tat-tat
      of a genteel visitor. No; it was a bad imitation of a postman&rsquo;s knock,
      followed by a faltering, sneaking tap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had any embarrassed individual, accustomed to visits from rent-distrainers
      or process-servers, heard that knock and caught sight of that man at his
      door, he would have instantly implored some other inmate of the house to
      tell the visitor that he had sailed to the furthest extremity of the
      Hudson Bay territory, and would never be home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, it was not alone that the knock was a tell-tale, but the
      man&rsquo;s dress also loudly proclaimed the purport of the visits he paid. Upon
      his head, slinking down to his eyebrows, was a hat which had long endured
      severe stress of weather, to its disadvantage. Upon his body&mdash;and
      that was his mark&mdash;he wore a loose brown great coat, styled by
      advertising tailors, &ldquo;the sack,&rdquo; It was dirty, discoloured, much worn at
      the pockets, and strongly impregnated with the odour of the cheapest and
      rankest tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      That coat, worn at the hottest end of June, betrayed him. It was his
      sign-board. A child brought up in that neighbourhood would have told you,
      by that coat, worn in the height of summer heats, the nature of his
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young goldsmith, on seeing him, held his breath; he had a conviction
      that the man&rsquo;s errand would of necessity prove an unpleasant one; and,
      after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, he stepped over the threshold of the
      shop-door, apparently engaged in looking up and down the street, but he
      never took his eye for an instant off the man in the dingy brown coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      That individual had just raised his extremely dirty fingers to repeat the
      offensive knock, when the street-door slowly opened, and an elderly,
      wan-faced man presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is her father,&rdquo; muttered the young goldsmith, retiring within his
      shop, yet only a few paces, for&mdash;though uninfluenced by any meanly
      inquisitive motives&mdash;he felt constrained to watch the proceedings of
      the shabby, brown-coated personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He observed the wan old man and his visitor engaged in rather a vigorous
      colloquy, conducted with brutal coarseness on the part of the man in the
      brown coat, and on the other side with the air of one upon whom some heavy
      and startling demand is made, which he is wholly unprepared or unable to
      meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some extravagant gestures had been exhibited by both persons, the
      individual in the dingy brown sack abruptly terminated it, by thrusting
      rudely back the pale-faced old man, springing past him, and ascending the
      stairs. Wringing his hands, with a distracted aspect, the old man
      staggered after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick eye of Harry Vivian had detected the agonised bearing of the old
      man during the whole time he was in conversation with his unwelcome
      visitor. He had with pain perceived the emotion of horror which seemed to
      paralyse his limbs as he tottered up the stairs after the dusky fellow,
      and, with nervous apprehension, he wondered what scene was then being
      enacted in the apartments above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that fair young creature present? In all human probability she was.
      Possibly subjected to the coarse insults of the unprepossessing individual
      who had forced his way into her presence. The teeth of the youth set
      firmly together as the thought intruded itself, and he felt that it would
      prove an infinite comfort to him, if he detected the vulgar rascal in any
      act of insolence addressed to her, to grip him by the nape of the neck,
      and fling him out of the window into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, old Harper, the goldsmith, his master, and his uncle too,
      made his appearance from an inner workshop. Young Vivian, who was racking
      his brain for a scheme which should enable him to make one of the party
      opposite, turned quickly to him and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, I am glad you have come in! There is the silver race cup from
      Rixon&rsquo;s, which ought to have been sent to the chaser&rsquo;s; it has been
      overlooked. It is wanted home quickly. Don&rsquo;t you think I had better run
      over with it at once to old Wilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilton! No, Hal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was so slow over the last things we gave him to chase. You ought to
      remember that, Hal, for you used to run over there constantly to urge him
      on, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal turned suddenly scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; continued the goldsmith; &ldquo;so in future, I think we had
      better send all these jobs to old Verity, at the back of the Sessions
      House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perspiration stood in small globes on the forehead of young Vivian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, sir,&rdquo; he said, with a pleading tone, &ldquo;that Wilton has been
      long in failing health, that it is not so long since he lost his wife. Oh!
      sir, this is not a time to take his work away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harper gently stroked his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, Hal, it is not,&rdquo; he said, after a short pause; &ldquo;but, at the
      same time, his unfortunate position is not an excuse we can offer to the
      firms who employ us for delay in the work with which we are entrusted; and
      it would be unfair to ourselves to allow the shortcomings of others to
      prove the occasion of loss of custom to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will answer for Wilton&rsquo;s punctuality this time,&rdquo; urged Hal,
      eagerly; &ldquo;and you know he is our best chaser. Shall I run over with it,
      and impress upon him that it is wanted as soon as it can be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well you may, Hal,&rdquo; said the goldsmith; &ldquo;but remember to point out to him
      the necessity for punctuality. Assure him that if there be any delay over
      the completion of this job, he may reckon it as the last he will have from
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apprentice, with a pleased smile, nodded his head, caught up the cup,
      which bore upon it a rare example of his own skill, and ran out of the
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment more, and a sharp ringing knock was heard at the door of the
      house in which dwelt old Wilton the gold chaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment, and the apprentice stood within the chamber he had so
      longed to enter, and he became at once a spectator and a participator in a
      painful scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds of angry altercation caught his ear as he reached the room
      door, the gruff tone of voice of the unwelcome guest preponderating.
      Acting upon and animated by an impulse which he perhaps would not have
      cared to acknowledge even to himself, he did not pause to crave admission,
      but entered the room without displaying the courtesy of a preliminary
      knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw before him old Wilton, and facing him the terror-dealing man in
      brown. They were at high words. On the appearance of Hal, both men became
      silent, and fixed their eyes intently and inquiringly upon him. They
      waited for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apprentice cast his eyes quickly round the room, but the maiden he
      hoped to see was not there, and he drew breath. He perceived that he was
      expected to commence the conversation, and, clearing his voice, he said,
      hurriedly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilton, I have some work here for you.&rdquo; He put the silver cup upon
      the table. It will require your nicest skill, and the instructions are
      therefore rather elaborate, so, if you please, I will wait until you are
      disengaged before I&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; exclaimed old Wilton, interrupting him, Snatching up the
      cup, he thrust it back into the arms of young Vivian&mdash;&ldquo;take it away&mdash;take
      it away!&rdquo; he added, almost frantically, &ldquo;it must not remain here now. No!
      no! no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the individual in the loose great coat, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! speak not,&rdquo; cried Wilton, hoarsely, glaring at him; and then
      turning to the apprentice, he ejaculated, with great excitement, &ldquo;Go&mdash;go;
      I beg&mdash;I entreat you to go away. Pray, young sir, go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I interposes a objection,&rdquo; intervened the former speaker, and,
      turning to Vivian, he said, with an assumption of authority&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      be so kind as to put that &rsquo;ere piece o&rsquo; plate down where you put it
      jes&rsquo; now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I do not?&rdquo; rejoined Vivian, sharply, turning his bright eye full
      upon the speaker, with an expression that savoured very strongly of a
      disposition to resist. The dirty man did not like the language it spake,
      but he affected not to be influenced by the threat it conveyed. He
      answered, temperately yet impressively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is jes&rsquo; what I don&rsquo;t suppose. Look here, young genl&rsquo;man, you don&rsquo;t
      know me&mdash;my name&rsquo;s Jukes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have been Snooks, or Wiggins, or any other name not down in the
      category of the young man&rsquo;s acquaintances or friends. The indifference he
      displayed on hearing it could not be greater if it had. He so expressed
      himself, for which Mr. Jukes rewarded him with a stare of astonishment,
      and whistled. Then he chuckled&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, you are,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but then you are young, you&rsquo;ll
      werry likely know me better some day. I&rsquo;m a sheriff&rsquo;s officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the youth recognised the office if he did not the man&rsquo;s name. A
      thrill ran through his frame as the fellow hissed the words between his
      teeth, and a sound like a low wail burst from the lips of old Wilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth turned towards him, his bosom swelling with the generous
      impulses natural to his age, and, in tones of earnest sincerity, he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Can I, in any way, aid you, Mr. Wilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone, the look, the gesture of the warm-hearted youth needed nothing
      to commend them to the keen appreciation of the old gold-worker, and his
      eyes filled with tears as the generous proffer fell upon his ears, but he
      shook his head sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Master Vivian,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you cannot help me. No, you
      cannot aid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know, Mr. Wilton, what I might be able to accomplish, if you
      would give me the opportunity,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;leave me to battle it out with this man as
      best I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And jes&rsquo; leave that cup afore you go,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Jukes, addressing
      Vivian. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll help the hassets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not intend to go yet,&rdquo; said Hal Vivian; &ldquo;but when I do, believe me I
      shall take no instructions from you about the destination of this cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jukes whistled shrilly by the united aid of his first and third
      fingers, and instantly the room door opened. A couple of yet shabbier and
      much dirtier personages than Mr. Jukes made their appearance. That
      individual waved his hand towards them, and performed the ceremony of
      introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nutty and Mr. Sudds, genl&rsquo;men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One on &rsquo;em, Mr.
      Nutty, I shall leave here in possession on a <i>fi. fa</i>., and Mr. Sudds
      will assist me in arresting Eustace Wilton on a <i>ca. sa.</i> and in
      taking on him a country walk to a spunging house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton turned as pale as death, and groaned in bitter anguish. Young
      Vivian felt a flush of heat pass over his frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be done?&rdquo; he asked of Jukes, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jukes raised his dirty hand to his mouth, and recklessly bit his foul
      thumb-nail. He plunged into a fit of reflection. Suddenly he raised his
      head, and said to his companions&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go outside a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed him, and quitted the room. Then he said to the youth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold warrants on two judgments against Wilton for one thousand pounds
      each. On the one I takes his traps, on the other I takes his body. So you
      see as he can&rsquo;t satisfy &rsquo;em, young mister, he&rsquo;ll be cleaned out,
      and become a reg&rsquo;lar pauper, on the poor side, in quod; and he must rot in
      quod, for he can&rsquo;t take the benefit of the hact, that I knows. That&rsquo;s bad
      enuff, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is horrible!&rdquo; ejaculated Hal, with a glance of commiseration at the
      old man, who, with downcast eyes and set teeth, was listening to every
      word that fell from the man&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Jukes, with an air of triumph. &ldquo;Now he may
      save himself from all this, and like the princesses and queen&rsquo;s children
      in fairy tales, live happy ever arterwards, if he chooses not to be
      hobstinate.&rdquo; Mr. Jukes spoke with emphasis. &ldquo;I wants him jes&rsquo; to sign a
      little bit o&rsquo; paper. He has only to make a flourish with a pen, and there
      he is a free man agin with all his traps about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jukes paused. Young Vivian approached old Wilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your position is a grave one, Mr. Wilton,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;let me respectfully
      suggest that if a simple signature will free you from two heavy claims&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand pounds, two <i>thousand</i> pounds!&rdquo; interposed Jukes,
      elevating his voice as he repeated the amount of the sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple signature!&mdash;simple signature!&rdquo; almost screamed the old man.
      &ldquo;You do not know what you ask, young sir. Sign it. Never! I will starve,
      rot, die, first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must starve, die, and rot,&rdquo; roared Mr. Jukes, entirely losing
      his previous equanimity. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no more o&rsquo; your nonsense. Hallo
      there! Sudds and Nutty, come in here, and let&rsquo;s go to business; ketch &rsquo;old
      of Eustace Wilton there, Sudds; and you, Nutty, begin to take a hinventory
      of these &rsquo;ere chattels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had the men thus summoned to appear, indulged themselves while outside the
      door with the pastime of listening at the keyhole, they could hardly have
      made a quicker response, than they did to the call of Jukes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they entered the room by one door, a young girl ran into it by
      another, and cast her arms about the old gold-worker&rsquo;s neck, saying, in an
      affrighted tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear father, who and why are these men here? why are you, in such
      grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man sank upon a seat; bowing his face upon the table and burying
      his hands in his gray hair, he sobbed with agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl only tightened her loving embrace, and turned her face towards
      the ruffians who were about to jest at the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the young Madonna-faced maiden Vivian had seen at the window,
      seeming like a golden seraph in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jukes perceived the exquisite countenance of Wilton&rsquo;s daughter turned
      with an aspect of distressed inquiry towards him, he instinctively removed
      the hat of many showers from his dusty head, and made her a slight bow.
      His satellites also approached as near as they could to an imitation of
      his action, and stood still, instead of displaying, as they had intended,
      a vast amount of unnecessary activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This respect was an instinctive tribute to her innocent loveliness. Purity
      commands reverence even as beauty does admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian felt, with a rising in the throat, a sudden desire to produce from
      his pocket&mdash;which contained but a very few shillings&mdash;several
      thousand pounds, with which to pay off the debt, and then an almost
      irresistible inclination to trundle down the stairs, and out of the house,
      the three fellows whose presence created so much misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could do nothing, however, but clear his voice, and, addressing the
      young lady, say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a most unhappy affair, Miss Wilton; and I regret very sincerely
      that it is in my power to do little either in the way of assistance or
      advice; but, with your permission, I will fetch over my uncle, Mr. Harper;
      he possesses vast experience, and no doubt he will show us a way out of
      this maze of difficulty and affliction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait for her permission, but running across the road, returned
      the silver cup to its former place; and, in a few hurried, passionate
      words, explained to his uncle what had occurred. He succeeded in
      prevailing on him to return with him to Wilton&rsquo;s apartments, in some vague
      hope that he would be able to suggest a mode by which the old man might be
      saved from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most painful scene followed the appearance of Mr. Harper. By pertinent
      questions, he elicited that, under circumstances which could not then be
      explained, Wilton had given bonds to the amount of two thousand pounds;
      that those bonds were over-due; that he had been sued for the recovery of
      the amount; that judgment had been obtained against him, and that
      execution had issued; but, withal, the man Jukes was empowered to withdraw
      arrest and execution, on the condition that Wilton signed a certain
      document which Jukes then had in his possession. This signature Wilton
      sternly and inflexibly refused to give; and when it was urged upon him to
      do so, for the sake of her who was wholly dependent upon him, he grew
      frenzied, and vowed that he would submit to death rather than comply. Mr.
      Harper, the goldsmith, finding that reasoning, expostulations,
      suggestions, and pleadings, were alike in vain, said there was no way to
      save him, and matters must take their course. Like a vulture pouncing upon
      its prey, Jukes seized upon the almost lifeless old man, and proceeded to
      drag him away. His daughter clung in horrified agony to him&mdash;in
      truth, it was a sad and painful sight. It was scarcely more than a year
      since death had ruthlessly torn her mother from this fair young child, and
      now it seemed as though the grim tyrant, in the person of Jukes, was
      robbing her of her father also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s knees trembled, and his under-jaw quivered, as though he had
      been smitten with the palsy. He embraced his daughter with frenzied
      emotion, and in tones of passionate grief, cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flo&rsquo;! Flo&rsquo;! my own, my beautiful darling, I leave you but for a brief
      time. Bear up against this dreadful visitation as bravely as you can, my
      girl. It is for the sake of your brother and for you, darling, that I
      endure this misery; but have trust, my child, in an all-righteous Creator&mdash;happiness
      will come to us again some day, my child&mdash;some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best, dear father, if you will take me with you,&rdquo; murmured
      Flora, through her blinding tears: &ldquo;I will strive to be brave, and to
      endure patiently and calmly; but oh! indeed, indeed it will terrible to be
      left here alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself upon his neck, and sobbed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harper coughed, a watery mist shrouded everything from the sight of
      young Vivian, but Mr. Jukes, declaring that he had no warrant of arrest
      against any &ldquo;gals,&rdquo; turned spitefully on old Wilton, tore him from the
      agonised embrace of his weeping child, and bore him away. Mr. Harper
      followed them down the stairs, to see that no unnecessary harshness was
      employed in conveying the trembling prisoner into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, Flora Wilton sank, half-fainting, into a chair, Hal
      approached her, and, in a gentle voice, he said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother Mark and I were intimate friends, Miss Wilton, before he
      went abroad&mdash;will you not also look upon me as a friend? It is not in
      my power to do much, yet all that I can do to serve you shall be done with
      my whole heart. Pray believe me. I will not obtrude upon the very natural
      grief which now so heavily weighs you down, but I entreat you, when you
      may need aid not to forget me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora rose up. She turned her large, beautiful eyes&mdash;yet more
      lustrous from the tears which filled them&mdash;upon him, and with a
      quivering lip, murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Vivian, kindness at a moment like this is doubly valuable. It has
      a language which of late has been very, very strange in our ears; and now
      that&mdash;that he&mdash;he is gone, I&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice gradually became inaudible, as her features were overspread with
      a death-like paleness. She stretched out her small white hand, as though
      to feel for some place to lean upon for support. She appeared at a moment
      to have been stricken with blindness; she tottered, swayed, to and fro,
      and would have fallen heavily upon the ground but that Hal, with a sudden
      cry, caught her in his strong arms and saved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation uttered by Vivian attracted the attention of Mr. Nutty. He
      was making out an inventory of the furniture in the room, and had just
      written down in a penny memorandum book, &ldquo;4 &rsquo;orsaire cheers, 1
      tabbel,&rdquo; when he heard the same voice cry&mdash;&ldquo;Run for some water!
      Quick! Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He responded instantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water be blowed; I can&rsquo;t go for no water; I&rsquo;m the man in possession.&rdquo;

      Sunbeams making a golden palace of a Gothic mansion in the Regent&rsquo;s Park,
      gilding its fretted roof, its traceries, and its triple arched and
      ornamented windows, tinting the graceful trees which gently waved in the
      gardens before and behind it, scattering golden stars upon the lake, and
      investing the flowers and shrubs with a beauty which rendered the place
      around little less than an earthly paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine and sunbeams in all places without the walls of the mansion&mdash;shadows
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a room, magnificently furnished, containing every appliance a morbid
      attention to personal comfort could need, or the invention of luxurious
      imagination could devise, were seated an elderly gentleman, his wife and
      three daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these girls was a beauty&mdash;all had pretensions to good looks,
      but she was strikingly handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the owner of this mansion was Grahame. He was a pale,
      stern-looking man. A dress suit of black, and a white cravat, which seemed
      to have the effect of being unpleasantly and rather dangerously tight
      about his neck, added to the austerity of his aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, an intensely proud woman, whose pride was apparent in her air,
      her dress, her features, sat like an imperious creature whose foible had
      no other quality than the worst species of haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the very frankest person in the world, she wore&mdash; <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">Her heart upon her sleeve, </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and displayed its entire sentiment in the material of which her attire was
      made, in its fashion, and in the style in which it was worn. The jewellery
      upon her wrists, her arms, her fingers, about her neck, and at her waist,
      betrayed the only feeling of which she was capable. She lived, moved,
      breathed in an atmosphere of inordinate, unreasoning pride&mdash;no other;
      and the &ldquo;people&rdquo; who came in contact with her felt it before she uttered a
      word to or glanced at them. In her eyes they were pottery of the commonest
      earthen material, whilst the clay of which she was herself formed,
      produced a porcelain of the rarest kind. So she sat; to be looked at, not
      touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, outwardly was of the same stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, he was begrimed with cowardly meanness, granite selfishness, a
      cringing obsequiousness to the wealthy and the powerful, and an icy
      haughtiness to all whom he understood to be his inferiors in position. By
      his standard, pride was measured as honour and nobility of soul, gold as
      the essence of all virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughters, brought up under such guidance, could hardly fail to be
      impregnated with the principles&mdash;or, rather, lack of principle&mdash;by
      which their parents were governed. Yet exercised upon the youngest, their
      influence failed to win a proselyte. Her organisation had not been adapted
      by nature to receive the impressions the authors of her being laboured to
      create, and, therefore, when she hazarded an opinion favourable to the
      purest sympathies of a kindly nature, or displayed an emotion which
      betrayed that she had a heart, she was called a fool, and treated as a
      pariah by the whole family. She had been christened Evangeline, but her
      imperial mamma frequently informed her it was a misnomer&mdash;that, in
      truth, her name should have been Gosling, which she had somewhere heard,
      meant a young goose, truly a young silly goose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second daughter resembled her mother in all things&mdash;was, in fact,
      her counterpart; she even bore her dualistic name, Margaret Claverhouse,
      and like her maternal parent, was supremely proud and hateful in all her
      characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest girl, the beauty of the family, was composed of somewhat
      discordant elements. In person she was eminently attractive, her figure
      was tall and commanding, and its outline was as graceful as its air was
      majestic. Her face, as we have said, was extremely beautiful, but he must
      have a bold heart, who, falling in love with it, would woo her in the
      expectation that he could win her with ease and retain her by
      indifference. Her features were regular, her eyes large, glittering, and
      of that deep brown which is often mistaken for black; her eyelids were
      full, and her eyelashes so long as really to form a fringe to the lid. Her
      eyebrows were arched, her hair was darker than her eyes, and not less
      brilliant. Her mouth was small, yet it had a sensual fulness, no less
      apparent then the scornful curl which ever seemed to keep it in a state of
      unrest. As the hand of her maid was skilled, and incessantly in
      requisition, the arrangement of her tresses&mdash;that wondrous ornament
      to woman&mdash;may be said to have been faultless. Her attire was
      admirably chosen to assist her beauty, and its fit was a triumph of the <i>modiste&rsquo;s</i>
      art. Her mother had instilled into her a belief that she was a queen of
      beauty, and she looked, thought, moved, as though she were an empress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet it was supposed that her affections had not been touched; from
      infancy she had been tutored to believe that to be human in feeling was to
      descend to the level of the common herd&mdash;that the world and what it
      contained were made for her, not she for the world. She was gifted with
      all the elements of which energy and passion are composed, and she was
      capable of loving with a force not often allotted even to woman; but her
      passions, her energies, her tenderness, had been rendered dormant by the
      counsels of worldly pride, as the warm, gushing, health-giving stream is
      converted by a slow frost into a silent, motionless block of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should there come before her eyes the man whose physical beauty and whose
      mental intelligence woke up her heart from its icy dream into passionate
      life, and that love should prove to be unrequited&mdash;woe! woe! to her!
      and possibly to him! She had been named Helen after a maternal relative,
      from whom the most exaggerated expectations were entertained, and she bore
      it as though she, in virtue of it, already possessed the vast inheritance
      it was understood to foreshadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This family were engaged&mdash;while the broad sunshine was gladdening the
      poor and the respectable, promenading in the park, into which the windows
      of the mansion looked&mdash;in discussing the conduct of the only son of
      the house of Grahame, who, instead of having obtained at college a &ldquo;double
      first&rdquo; for the honour of the family, had forwarded home a packet of
      tradesmen&rsquo;s accounts, the gross total of which considerably exceeded the
      handsome allowance placed to his credit by his father. Mr. Grahame spoke
      with considerable dissatisfaction of the course his son must have pursued
      to have plunged thus largely into debt; and, though it was in accordance
      with his wish that his son had for his college companions and intimate
      acquaintances, the Duke of St. Allborne, the young Earl of Carlton, and
      the experienced Lord Suedmuch, yet he thought that even their intimacy, at
      the price his son had paid for it, or rather that which <i>he</i> was
      called upon to pay, much too dear, and he expressed himself on the subject
      with an emphasis which his pride rendered unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grahame turned upon him a sidelong glance with her half-closed eyes,
      and, said coldly and contemptuously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Grahame! The members of that race are not used to measure their
      wants, their pleasures, or even their caprices, by miserable
      considerations of economy. I said to Malcolm, when we parted&mdash;&lsquo;Remember,
      always, that you are a Grahame. If those with whom you associate act as
      though their wealth ran a stream whose source is inexhaustible, let your
      expenditure be no less illimitable than theirs, even to represent, in
      wealth, a river whose&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confluence is a sea of dissipation and of debt,&rdquo; sharply exclaimed Mr.
      Grahame, taking a pinch of snuff out of a gold, diamond-studded snuff-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grahame, your sense of the dignity of your position is becoming
      impaired,&rdquo; responded the stately lady, wholly closing her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;pardon me, I simply, object to unnecessary and
      preposterous extravagance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of ineffable disdain passed over the lady&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claver&rsquo;se Grahame,&rdquo; she remarked, in a frigid tone, &ldquo;have you, at a
      moment, become poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of Mr. Grahame instantly changed to a brilliant scarlet hue, then
      to a purple, finally it became livid. Globules of cold perspiration
      gathered thickly upon his brow. He thrust his chair back a few paces, and
      there was something of an affrighted expression in his eyes as he gazed
      upon hen. Her eyelids were yet close down over her pale gray eyes as he
      wiped the deathly damp from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen Grahame turned her bright dark eyes upon him with a scornful look.
      In her estimation, the concentration of meanness of soul was to place a
      limit upon lavish expenditure. She did not utter a word, but she tried to
      balance in her own mind which of the two occasioned her father the most
      terror&mdash;her mother&rsquo;s cold displeasure or Malcolm&rsquo;s extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret thought with her sister that economy was but another word for a
      despicable narrowness of soul. Not but that she was economical enough when
      called upon for an exercise of charity; but for any selfish purpose, a
      compulsory contraction of expenditure would have been regarded by her as
      an example of the lowest and most vulgar niggardliness. She listened with
      disdain to her parent, and thought that it was incumbent upon her father
      to give like a Grahame, in order that her brother Malcolm should lavish it
      like a Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evangeline, to whom the conversation had been distressing observing that
      her father had become suddenly silent; raised her soft eyes and marked the
      expression that passed over his features. In alarm she hastily left her
      seat, and in a low, affectionate tone, said, as she took his hand and
      leaned over him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear sir, you are not well, you are agitated, can I&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your seat, Evangeline;&rdquo; he exclaimed hoarsely; as he drew his hand
      from her petulantly. &ldquo;I am not agitated&mdash;I am well&mdash;you are
      obtrusive and impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evangeline retreated to her place at the window; she took up the
      embroidery on which she had been engaged, and went on with it in silence,
      but a tear dropped upon her work; no one heeding the &ldquo;young silly goose,&rdquo;
       it passed unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grahame spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malcolm is coming home,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he has invited two of his college
      companions&mdash;the young Duke of St. Allborne, and the Honourable Lester
      Vane to accompany him here on a visit. No doubt Mr. Grahame, you will not
      lose so valuable an opportunity to impress upon your son, in the presence
      of his spendthrift associates, that your narrow income forbids your
      meeting claims which&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Grahame, tartly, &ldquo;it is you who are losing a
      sense of your position now. Let us change the subject. I will speak with
      Malcolm upon his return. A proper maintenance of his position, and the
      honour of his House is one thing: a disreputable squandering of his income
      quite another. In that spirit I speak now&mdash;in that spirit will I
      address myself to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the Honourable Lester Vane?&rdquo; inquired Margaret Grahame of her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man of an ancient and high family,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grahame&mdash;&ldquo;immensely
      rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very handsome,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen; adding, &ldquo;so at least Malcolm writes
      me. He praises him highly, declares that he possesses great personal
      attractions, and is sure&mdash;I&mdash;we shall all like him much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not name him in the few lines he wrote to me,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did to you, Eva, did he not?&rdquo; remarked Helen, turning her
      brilliant eyes with a mocking glance upon her youngest sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gush of tears came again into the eyes of Evangeline. She did not raise
      them from her employment, that her emotion might be seen by her sisters.
      She answered with a quivering lip, and in a low, faltering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Malcolm had not time to write to me. I have had no letter from
      him since he has been gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled. She was not accustomed to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Absurd! do you think he would write to you? what conceit!&rdquo; she
      observed, with a gesture of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      What other feeling should she entertain for a sister who possessed merely
      the cardinal virtues, and was utterly deficient in an appreciation of
      worldly pomps and vanities?
    </p>
    <p>
      At this part of the conversation, there was a tap at the door of the
      apartment; it opened at the same moment, and an individual, attired in a
      suit of black of the most approved court dress cut, advanced into the
      room. The eyes of the family were turned upon him, but he scarcely
      appeared to be disposed to collapse under that honour. His neck was
      garnished with an unexceptionable cravat, which was arranged with such
      precision that it seemed to be wrought in alabaster and carved
      elaborately. His wig&mdash;for as he confessed to admiring <i>confreres</i>,
      he had dispensed with his &ldquo;own &rsquo;air&rdquo;&mdash;looked as though it had
      been subjected to a severe storm of whitewash and had been violently
      brushed. He approached his master, and, bending over him, said, in a
      confidential manner, yet with a gesture of grave but humble deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet pesson is come, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;what person?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Grahame with the air of one who
      denied the right of any &ldquo;person&rdquo; to seek an audience with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pesson concerning which you gave me hin-structions, sir&mdash;I asked
      &rsquo;im into the libree, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into my library, man?&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, rising up, angrily. &ldquo;Pray what
      does the fellow mean? How dare you ask any &lsquo;person&rsquo; into my library
      without my instructions to that effect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he were Mr. Chewkle, sir, and if you please to remember&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Mr. Grahame turned as pale as death, and then changed to an
      intense crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!&rdquo; he cried hurriedly, altering his tone; &ldquo;return
      to him&mdash;say I will come to him immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed, and quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame walked to the window and looked out into the sunlight. It lay
      upon the grassy lawn, upon the sloping meads, upon the waving trees, like
      gleaming gold dust. The soft breeze made the leaves flutter merrily, birds
      darted to and fro in the clear air, singing gaily, and brilliantly attired
      ladies and children moved over the open places in the broad park, animated
      by the beauty of the scene, and the glory of the sunshine. Mr. Grahame
      looked distastefully upon it, it ill-assorted with the feelings at war
      within his breast, and he turned from it with an impatient exclamation. He
      set his teeth together, drew a long breath, and, with his features more
      pallid than usual, strode out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grahame&mdash;too much occupied with visions of her own dignity, when
      she thought at all, which was not often&mdash;took no notice of the
      disturbed manner of her husband. If she had seen it, she would not have
      credited the evidence of her own eyes. A Grahame disturbed or agitated,
      the thing was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither did Helen, who was sketching fancy portraits of the Honourable
      Lester Vane; nor Margaret, who was not even troubled by an effort of
      imagination, observe him; but Evangeline perceived his inward
      perturbation, and not daring to offer a word, or breathe a hope that she
      might aid in alleviating it, sat sadly at her needlework, filled with a
      foreboding that something foreshadowed trial and affliction to the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame descended to his library. In one corner of it, upon the edge
      of a chair, under which his hat was placed, sat, with his knees close
      together, and his toes poised on the floor, a strange looking personage, a
      sort of hybrid between a fast banker&rsquo;s clerk, and an undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle was an agent; a commission agent. He undertook any description
      of business, no matter what. He sold coals and coffee, he introduced
      distracted tradesmen to usurious bill-discounters. He offered two
      shillings and sixpence in the pound to indignant creditors for unhappy
      insolvents. He would supply you with a good article in tea, at two and
      eight. He raised money on mortgage and <i>post obit</i>, having a friend
      who did that sort of thing for spendthrifts who needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid out money on fancy horses for fast individuals, with imaginary
      betting-men, though the horses he backed for them were rarely landed
      winners at the post. He knew all the good investments in mines, and would
      obtain shares for anybody, at a comparatively low price, though some day
      they &ldquo;might&rdquo; be at fabulous premiums. He&mdash;but he would undertake
      anything whatever, clean or dirty, if paid his commission, and &ldquo;ask no
      questions,&rdquo; when the remunerator was liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose up as Mr. Grahame entered, and made him a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Chewkle,&rdquo; said Mr. Grahame, loftily; &ldquo;well, what success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our man, safe, sir,&rdquo; he replied, with a feeble grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spunging-house, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the apartments, sir, but we shall move the goods to-morrow, for sale
      by the sheriff, and then they must go out you know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the streets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the streets, sir, or the work&rsquo;us. They&rsquo;ve no resources, as I sees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, of course he has signed the undertaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;not yet, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame had seated himself with the air of a Mogul emperor giving
      audience to a Hindoo slave. He rose to his feet as if a pistol-shot had
      been discharged at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not! Nonsense!&rdquo; he cried with fierce astonishment; &ldquo;under such pressure,
      the man cannot possibly refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he does, sir, and swears he will not sign if he has to starve and rot
      in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame passed his hand over his mouth, and gulped as if he would
      choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do without it, sir,&rdquo; suggested Chewkle, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous! His signature must be to the deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Chewkle, slowly, and looking carefully round the
      room to see that no other person was present, &ldquo;so it may be there on the
      deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame looked at him steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle reduced his voice to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got his name on a letter, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very difficult to write like it, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chewkle!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, with dilated eyes, &ldquo;what do you
      counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir. I merely suggests that if the signature must be there on
      the deed, no obstinate old fool should prevent its being placed there and,
      where money is not a hobject, it can easily be managed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s teeth chattered, as if he had been suddenly transported into
      a frosty atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chewkle,&rdquo; he said, grimly, &ldquo;do you know what the law declares such an act
      to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle nodded with perfect self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be done, sir,&rdquo; he rejoined emphatically. &ldquo;Your position depends
      on it. You must balance beggary, destitution, ruin, against rank, fortune,
      dignity&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgery!&rdquo; groaned Mr. Grahame, sinking into his chair, and pressing his
      hands over his eyes.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the dreams of
      Harry Vivian the delicate form and sweet, smiling face of Flora Wilton had
      appeared to him, and not unfrequently. But then she seemed ever to be some
      queen of faëryland, seated on a throne of gems of dazzling brilliancy, in
      floral realms of more exquisite beauty than mortal eye had ever beheld on
      earth, or waking fancy in its most gorgeous development could conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his moments of romantic imaginings, when his mind was filled with her
      beauty, he certainly had sketched a few scenes comprising events in which
      both he and Flora figured. Still his ardent imagination had not carried
      him beyond the presentation of a flower, and the reward for the gift with
      which the soft grateful look from eyes, the loveliest in the world, would
      enrich him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never foreshadowed a time&mdash;for true love is ever subdued in
      action by the most genuine modesty&mdash;when he should within his arms,
      press to his throbbing heart the form which had in his eyes no equal, or
      that the face so rare in its perfection, should recline upon his shoulder,
      close to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet so it chanced to be. Circumstances he could have never shaped had come
      to pass, and the bliss of entwining his arms about the small, delicate
      waist of Flora Wilton was bestowed upon him at a moment the most
      unexpected, when he was unprepared to welcome it and unable to enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, rather than bliss, the emotion he experienced might be said to have
      been one of terror; not without its gratification, it is true, for he
      would not have resigned her, senseless as she was, to another for worlds.
      Still the deathly hue with which her features were overspread, the
      compressed lips, the closed eye, from which a tear had struggled, and,
      disengaging itself, lodged yet upon her cheek, made him fear that the
      frightful visitation which had so suddenly fallen upon her was a calamity
      greater than her gentle nature was able to sustain. He grew himself cold
      and faint as the supposition crossed him that, unless some sudden and
      energetic measures were adopted, she would pass from her swoon into the
      unawakening sleep of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unacquainted with anything pertaining to fainting fits, and under a strong
      impression that swooning and giving up the ghost were synonymous, his
      calls for water and for aid merged from the vehement into the frantic; he
      unheeded the representations made by Mr. Nutty that men in possession
      never quit the sight of goods placed in their charge until the amount they
      represent is satisfied; he threatened him most fiercely for not flying to
      execute his commands; but, at the close of a paroxysm of rage and
      agitation, he found Flora yet senseless in his arms, and Mr. Nutty dancing
      and declaiming, vowing that he would take the &ldquo;lor&rdquo; of &ldquo;any willin as
      strove to hinterrupt him in his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this harangue by Mr. Nutty upon the majesty of his
      professional avocation, the door of the apartment opened, and a young girl
      glided in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had met old Wilton on the stairs, in custody of the officers, and had
      seen him borne away. She had loitered outside of the door of the apartment&mdash;she
      heard the low, sobbing wail of the afflicted girl, whose tears were wrung
      from her by the terrifying conviction that her destruction was involved in
      the loss of her father. She heard, too, the calls of Vivian, together with
      the angry colloquy between him and Nutty, and then she decided on offering
      her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was only a cap-front maker, working for a wholesale house in the city,
      producing the fronts worn inside women&rsquo;s bonnets, for sevenpence halfpenny
      per dozen. She rose at six in the morning, and worked until twelve at
      night, in order to complete two dozen per diem. Out of the sum thus
      realized weekly she had to live, pay her lodging, and find herself in
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she had not much time on her hands, nor much money in her pocket, and
      was what the every-day world calls a person of no importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had a heart&mdash;a gentle, compassionate, loving heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a very pretty girl, though her complexion was something wan, and
      her eyelids were rather tinged with pink; but if these appearances
      detracted something from her prettiness, what did they not add to the
      interest and the sympathy raised in the beholder? They told of early
      rising and midnight toil, the rapid wearing out of young and beautiful
      human life, so that thousands of thoughtless beings of her own sex might
      set off to advantage their facial attractions&mdash;<i>CHEAPLY</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to lengthen this digression&mdash;for we shall know much more of this
      young damsel by and by&mdash;Lotte Clinton, for that was her name, hearing
      the cry of young Vivian for water, entered the apartment, prepared to
      offer her services if they were likely to be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Flora Wilton lying in the arms of Hal Vivian, whose handsome face
      she recognised in an instant, for she had often observed it from her
      garret window upturned to the house in which she dwelt, though his look
      reached not so high as where she sat peering behind her mignionette and
      nasturtiums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal knew her not, but just now she made her appearance, to his conception,
      as an angel newly come from Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his eager eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wilton is in deep affliction,&rdquo; he said, quickly, &ldquo;she has fainted;
      will you be so good as to bring some water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place her in a chair,&rdquo; said Lotte, softly, &ldquo;she will be better there&mdash;she
      will have more air. I will run for water, and my smelling salts. Sometimes
      at night, I grow faint and dizzy, and cannot see my work, and they relieve
      me then wonderfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said this as she hurried out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor girl! She had but too often had occasion to use the stimulant for the
      purpose she named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian almost unconsciously felt a reluctance to resign his beautiful
      burden, but he could not help seeing that the course proposed by Lotte was
      the proper one to be adopted; therefore he placed the yet lifeless Flora,
      with the tenderest carefulness, upon a chair, and supported her drooping
      head upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte, swift of foot, had not been a minute obtaining the ammoniacal salts
      and a teacup with water in it. She did not possess a tumbler, for she
      could not afford herself beer, and the water she took at her dinner, or
      supper&mdash;when she could afford to indulge in the latter luxury&mdash;was
      as sweet to her out of a cup as a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set to work, as a woman almost instinctively proceeds in these
      matters. While she had all that tender sympathy and commiseration which
      the condition of Flora could elicit from any one imbued with a generous
      susceptibility, she was endowed also with that species of calm
      self-possession and firm collectedness, so valuable in emergencies where
      human life is at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set Vivian to work bathing with the cool water the white temples from
      which his trembling fingers had parted the long waving hair, while she
      herself applied the ammonia to the nostrils of Flora, and chafed her palms
      when the inhalation had done its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus assaulted, nature returned to its duty, and reasserted its claims
      over the motionless system of the young girl, who gradually opened her
      eyes. Gazing wildly about her, she abruptly rose up from her seat, as
      though she had awakened out of some painful dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces of Vivian and Lotte seemed to confuse her; but when her large,
      sad eyes fell upon the unattractive countenance of Mr. Nutty, turned upon
      her with an aspect in which the expression was undecided&mdash;as he was
      not certain whether the swoon was a sham or a fact&mdash;memory returned,
      and her bereavement, with the future and all the horrors of its
      uncertainty&mdash;save that the direst poverty must attend it&mdash;burst
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrung her hands in the fulness of her misery, and then she murmured
      through her blinding tears&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almighty Father! support me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lotte stole her arm about Flora&rsquo;s waist, and whispered in her ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Miss Wilton! you have friends who will not desert you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she asked, bitterly. &ldquo;I know of no relative, save my father and
      my brother. My father is in prison, my brother is far, far away, and I am
      a homeless, helpless, hopeless outcast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hopeless!&rdquo; exclaimed Vivian; &ldquo;do not say that, Miss Wilton! Remember
      that I have told you, Mark and I were friends before he went away. I know
      him so well that I believe if any near and dear relative of mine were,
      during my absence, to fall into trouble and affliction, he would be the
      first to come forward and help her, and, as his friend, what he would do
      that ought I to do. I make no boast; but, oh! Miss Wilton, do not fear but
      that I will do my best, and that at least you shall not be helpless nor
      homeless while I can command a shilling, and have strength to work for
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are a dear fellow, and make me foolish enough to cry, and I wish
      you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lotte, her eyes suffused with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, likewise, you are young and green&mdash;pea-green,&rdquo; thought Mr.
      Nutty, as he put down in his inventory, &ldquo;1 large spewn, 1 chimblee
      ornymint, and 1 arthwrugg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora, with eyes beaming with gratitude, proffered her hand to Vivian, who
      took it and pressed it. It would have been a dear delight to him to have
      kissed it, but he felt that this was not a time for such a display of
      gallantry or feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not how to thank you, Mr. Vivian,&rdquo; she said, in trembling accents,
      &ldquo;but I fear I cannot, while I sincerely appreciate your generous offers of
      assistance to me, avail myself of them. Your friendship for my brother
      gives to me no claim upon your aid, neither does it entitle me to accept
      it; and, guided by the precepts and counsels my dear father has implanted
      in my mind, I seem clearly to comprehend that it would be&mdash;may I say&mdash;an
      indiscretion were I to act otherwise than in most grateful terms to
      decline what your disinterested generosity has prompted you to propose. I
      confess that I have been terribly shocked and shaken by what has occurred,
      but the nervous tremor I at this moment endure will pass away, and I shall
      look with fervent faith to a brighter time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young and green, too,&rdquo; thought Mr. Nutty&mdash;&ldquo;sap-green,&rdquo; and placed in
      his inventory, &ldquo;1 immidge&mdash;a figgur of Oap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lotte interposed, as Hal, with rather a disconcerted aspect, was about to
      urge her acceptance of his renewed offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see, Mr. Vivian,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;what tomorrow will bring
      forth. At present everything is in confusion; by to-morrow we shall know
      the worst; what can be done, and what there will remain to do. Then Miss
      Wilton will be better able to judge in what you can be of service to her,
      and I have no doubt she will feel less reluctance to accept the kindly aid
      you have offered in such a friendly and worthy manner now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sensible girl, that,&rdquo; thought Mr. Nutty, &ldquo;works for her livin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ard,
      too, I&rsquo;ll be bound!&rdquo; He put down at the same moment in his inventory, &ldquo;a
      peece of clokk wurk wownd up and goen; 1 nutmy graytur; 1 coles scuddel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal, seeing that the advice tendered by Lotte Clinton was acceptable to
      Flora, resolved to follow it, and turning to the former, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand far better than I do the way to manage in such a matter as
      this. I am only anxious to be of service, and my intention is sincere. I
      may, by a want of tact, produce an effect entirely opposite to that which
      I most desire. You are intelligent and good natured&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Lotte, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and I fancy you interpret justly my sincerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I do,&rdquo; she answered promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I place myself in your hands; you will not leave Miss Wilton for the
      present?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a minute,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all that I could hope you to be,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;and if I can help
      you, you will send for me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will!&rdquo; responded Lotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Farewell, Miss Wilton&mdash;keep up your spirits;
      &lsquo;When matters are at their worst they mend,&rsquo; you know, and surely your
      affairs could hardly be in a more unhappy predicament than at this moment.
      Preserve your faith in the goodness of God, and do not despair of the
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora could not reply; she could only return the pressure of his hand, and
      then hide her face upon the neck of Lotte Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal then breathed a few words into the ear of Nutty to the effect that,
      though he was an officer of the law, engaged in one of its most unpleasant
      duties, it was quite possible for him to do his &ldquo;spiriting gently,&rdquo; but
      that if he should entertain a contrary opinion, and offer, or attempt to
      offer, to carry out in a spirit of hostility, arrogance, and coarseness,
      the part he had to perform, he might prepare himself for a reckoning, the
      settlement of which would not be in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nutty was too old a hand at his craft not to know that it was best to be
      civil, when as he, in rather free terms, said&mdash;&ldquo;There was summat
      hanging to it;&rdquo; or to hesitate to be a brute when the utter poverty of the
      poor creatures whose goods were seized rendered even his possession money
      a question of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present case, he very sagaciously saw that if he acted in an
      apparently compassionate and considerate spirit to the daughter of old
      Wilton, and took care to let his behaviour come to the ears of young
      Vivian, his purse would be rendered all the heavier by it; but if he
      adopted an abrupt harshness of manner, terrified her, and permitted her to
      save no little trinket, upon which she set some priceless personal value,
      he might get a horse-whipping, inflicted with no light or unwilling hand.
      He took; therefore, the suggestion of Vivian in good part, winked his eyes
      significantly, jerked his thumb over his left shoulder, placed his thumb
      to his nose, fluttered his fingers, and otherwise bewildered the
      apprentice, who could only presume that these evolutions meant that his
      wishes should be complied with. He, therefore, thought it incumbent upon
      him, not only to seem to comprehend them, but to so far imitate them, by
      slapping his pocket, tapping the palm of his hand with one finger, and
      pointing to Nutty, so as to give that grubby individual to understand that
      if he behaved kindly, there <i>would</i> be something &ldquo;hanging to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nutty smiled complacently, bent the most philanthropic and benevolent of
      glances upon Flora, nodded his head, and murmured, with a slight grin&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knows all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus assured, Harry Vivian waved his hand towards Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep up your spirits!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;all will go right yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with an effort, he quitted the room, ran lightly down the stairs,
      and was soon in his uncle&rsquo;s private room, engaged with him in earnest
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Lotte busied herself at the sacrifice of at least a dozen
      cap fronts, or rather half a dozen hours, to be replaced by six taken out
      of those devoted by her during the week to sleep, in conferring with Flora
      as to the course she would have to pursue when all the furniture was swept
      away, and she was left penniless and destitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no relations in London?&rdquo; inquired Lotte; &ldquo;because if you have
      only one or two, I will pop on my bonnet and mantle, and run to them very
      quickly. Let them be who they may, they would surely afford you some
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard my father speak even of one in London or elsewhere,&rdquo;
       returned Flora. &ldquo;We have lived very secluded while here. We have not
      always lived thus. I can remember dwelling in a large house, with
      beautiful furniture, mirrors, chandeliers, and gorgeous decorations;
      lovely gardens, with fountains and flowers. But that is long, long ago. I
      know not when, I know not why, we left it, or when or how we came here. It
      seems to me that I awakened from a dream of faëryland, to find myself in
      these poor apartments, and my poor father destroying his life by the
      deadly closeness of his application to his labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, then, of no relations you could ask to help you?&rdquo; said Lotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor friends whose assistance you might ask?&rdquo; Flora shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any money to go on with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, which for safety is placed&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I want to know nothing about it,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Nutty, abruptly.
      &ldquo;See here&mdash;when I put down in my hin-vent-ory any harticle, you
      daren&rsquo;t touch it arterwards; leastwise, you must give it up as I&rsquo;ve put it
      down; but you know you can do as you like with anything as I don&rsquo;t put
      down. Do you tumble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nutty, having rather a mean opinion of the worldly experience of
      Flora, addressed his speech to Lotte, but that young lady, who had a
      shrewd guess at the intention sought to be conveyed in the first speech,
      did not comprehend quite clearly the last sentence, unless, as she
      conceived, the man had a notion that her professional avocation was
      dancing on horseback and leaping through hoops or over poles, held by
      colonels in the army of the Emperor of the Brazils. She, therefore,
      thanked him for the suggestion he offered, but at the same time mystified
      him by informing him that she had never been on horseback in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few whispers she made Flora understand Nutty&rsquo;s meaning, and suggested
      that if there happened to be any article to which she attached any
      particular value, now was the time to transfer it to a place of safety,
      beyond the jurisdiction of Mr. Nutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora hesitated to avail herself of the offer&mdash;not so Lotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my room,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no one can enter it unless I please: I have
      the key. You can put anything you like within it; and I should like to see
      any one dare to come in and attempt to take it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Flora hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These people seem to have the power to take all,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;and if
      they are justly entitled to their claim, it would be an act of dishonesty
      to keep anything back from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Lotte. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that they are
      justly entitled, and therefore you have the right to assume that they are
      not. They act, at all events, like hard-hearted brutes, and that is why <i>I</i>
      believe they have no more right to a single thing here than I have. So I
      should act just as if they had not. Now I will tell you what my advice is.
      You point out to me what you, in your heart, should like to save, and
      leave the rest to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>is</i> a sensible gal,&rdquo; muttered Nutty, as he entered in his
      inventory&mdash;&ldquo;1 save-orl, a arm chare and 1 floured assik.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a gentle knock at the room door, and Mr. Nutty
      opened it about two inches, and peered through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;ye want?&rdquo; said he gruffly, to some one without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Clinton&mdash;is she here?&rdquo; asked a pleasant voice without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know her&mdash;don&rsquo;t live here,&rdquo; said Nutty, slamming the door to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it&mdash;open the door!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;it is my brother Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant she put Nutty aside, opened the door, and putting her head
      out, said, hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Charley; I am so glad you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a sound as of the chirruping of young sparrows. It was
      Charley and Lotte performing the usual act of grace on meeting each other,
      it being customary for the pair to kiss a dozen times in rapid succession&mdash;a
      quick fire, painful only to those who don&rsquo;t participate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte led forward her brother, a rather smartly-dressed young man, and
      introduced him to Flora, with a manner which plainly said&mdash;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he
      a nice fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was, however, in no mood for introductions to strangers, she bowed,
      but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley is a lawyer,&rdquo; said Lotte, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora slightly bowed again, without comprehending that the fact would be
      of any advantage to her, and Mr. Nutty snorted as if he instantly smelt
      hostile opposition to his supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, Charley was a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, on twenty-five shillings per
      week, but he had improved the opportunities he possessed by working very
      hard, reading up the best works on the study and practice of the law,
      making himself master of cases which were precedents, and, in fact, doing
      his best to fit himself either for the bar, if he could raise the
      necessary funds to be called to it, or to be a first-class solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His principal object, as at present entertained by him, was to place his
      sister above the reach of want, and the necessity for her present
      life-destroying labour. He little knew how hard the work, how small the
      earnings. Out of his narrow weekly salary he contrived occasionally to
      make her little presents, and certainly he visited no place or person more
      regularly or more frequently than he did the humble abode of his sister.
      Not that he went much anywhere, for he well knew that eminence in the path
      he had marked out to pursue could not be achieved unless by an incessant
      and persevering study, which has destroyed more men than it has ever made
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte knew of his devotion to his task&mdash;how he sat poring over
      dreadfully dry books, lighted in his task by the midnight oil, and
      supported in his trying work by the noble hope that he should be able some
      day to keep her like a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      How dearly she loved him for it, no one could know but herself; and, in
      addition, she thought him the cleverest lawyer in existence, much worthier
      in respect of merit to preside over the bench of judges than the Lord
      Chief Justice himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore when she mentioned to Flora that he was a lawyer, she fully
      expected to see her leap with delight, and she felt disappointed that she
      did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to prove his incontestable superiority, she, in rapid terms,
      explained to him what had occurred, and begged him to display the legal
      knowledge which she was sure he possessed, by ordering Mr. Nutty to quit
      the premises instanter, and to consider himself fortunate if he did so
      without receiving that shaking to which she fully believed he was
      entitled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such was the influence of Flora&rsquo;s loveliness on him, that, after one
      careful perusal of her fair lineaments, he needed no urging from his
      sister to render assistance if he could. He did not ask himself whether
      his exertions would be made in a deserving cause; he knew they would be
      performed on behalf of one possessing rare personal attractions, and under
      his first impressions that sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He commenced action by questioning Mr. Nutty, who exhibited most restive
      indications under examination. Charley demanded to see the warrant under
      which Mr. Nutty held possession, which Mr. Nutty refused, but, under the
      bewildering, sharp, quick, and pertinent questions of the young lawyer, he
      let slip the fact that Mr. Jukes had gone away without lodging it with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not certain that Mr. Jukes has it, I dare be sworn!&rdquo; cried
      Charley, looking at him, fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I am&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my oath on it. I seed it in his hand, when he made the seizure, and
      he ort to a gev&rsquo; it me afore he went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he was so okkepied with his prisoner that he took it with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must go after him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must! You have no warrant you know, therefore, you are <i>not</i>
      in <i>possession</i>. In point of fact and of law&mdash;you are guilty of
      an act of trespass. You had better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t budge a hinch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall make you! If you resist, I will fling you over the banisters
      to the passage below!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not hurt him too much!&rdquo; interposed Lotte, with a half-frightened look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if he goes quietly&mdash;but out he must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you uses wiolence, I&rsquo;ll have the lor on you!&rdquo; cried Nutty, in evident
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall only use the proper force to put you into the street, and, unless
      you at once disappear, I warn you you must take the consequences of the
      false position in which you know, as well as I do, your employer, through
      his negligence, has placed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t a&rsquo;going!&rdquo; cried Nutty, folding his arms, and placing his back
      against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Charley, &ldquo;that is a point we have to determine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught Mr. Nutty firmly by the wrist, and then giving his own hand an
      overturn, and Mr. Nutty&rsquo;s an underturn, he, with his left hand seized him
      by his collar, and drew him at a rapid rate towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nutty uttered a yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;le&rsquo;go my arm, your&rsquo;e dexlycatin&rsquo; on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley, however, heeded him not, but put him outside the door on to the
      landing. The man in possession was thus no longer entitled to his
      cognomen.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>harley had barely
      re-entered the room when Mr. Jukes burst into it with a sudden crash,
      followed by Sudds and Nutty, A noisy and angry colloquy instantly ensued,
      but Charley was too well acquainted with the character of the men he had
      to deal with either to permit himself to be bullied or browbeaten, and he
      had no intention that they should maintain their standing upon illegal
      documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authorised by Flora Wilton, and in the name of her father, he demanded to
      see the warrant of execution upon the goods. Jukes refused; he had come
      back to take them away, and had a van at the door for that purpose.
      Charley, however, would on no account allow this. He defied Jukes to
      remove the furniture until the proper return had been made to the sheriff,
      or until the claims of the landlord had been satisfied. He interposed
      other legal objections, and raised points of a technical description on
      the face of the warrant, which Jukes had at length produced, until even
      that astute personage became mystified, and consented to leave things in
      <i>statu quo</i> until the morning, when, having obtained advice from the
      solicitor by whom he had been employed, he should be prepared to act with
      more determined vigour than now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be borne in mind that Mr. Jukes had been promised a handsome
      remuneration if he succeeded in obtaining old Wilton&rsquo;s signature to a
      document confessed to be of great importance, and he knew that it was not
      exactly his best course to act in such a manner as to drive the man
      frenzied with rage by the harsh and heartless proceedings he was
      instructed to take. He was well aware that a strong pressure must be
      applied to bring the obstinate old gold-chaser to compliance with the
      demand now made upon him, but he was also shrewd enough to surmise that an
      overpressure would have the contrary effect to that desired, and, instead
      of disposing old Wilton to sign, would render him more firmly than ever
      fixed on his refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warrant was, therefore, with due ceremony, handed to Mr. Nutty, and he
      was instructed to remain until either the claim, under which possession
      was held, had been paid, or he was directed to quit. He received it with a
      grim smile of satisfaction, and prepared to go on with his inventory with
      an inflexible resolve that the most treasured article of affection should
      not after this escape being recorded in his list.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even now things were not to remain as thus arranged. The door of the
      apartment, which had been closed, was once more unceremoniously thrown
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man, with a shrivelled face of a deep turmeric hue, as if the
      yellow jaundice had been for years his favourite complaint, stalked rather
      than walked into the room. He was a singular-looking man, with a certain
      peculiarity in his mien which would prevent the possibility of his going
      anywhere in society without his being stared at. He wore a violet-coloured
      cloth frock coat, a buff waistcoat, as yellow as his own face, and
      chocolate trousers, almost tight enough to be pantaloons; upon his feet,
      which were small, were polished boots, and upon his head a bright, black,
      carefully brushed beaver hat, very much turned up at the brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was followed by a small man, dressed all in black, save his cravat; his
      whiskers and his hair were <br /><br /><span class="indent15">White with the
      whiteness of what is dead, </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and formed a strange contrast to his garb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow-visaged old gentleman, on gaining the middle of the room,
      turned a pair of jet black, brilliant eyes upon Mr. Jukes and smiled, not
      auspiciously but cynically, and yet triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wrong room?&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Jukes, suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the old man, exhibiting a row of teeth, which
      appeared ghastly in that golden visage. &ldquo;My name is Nathan Gomer; this
      house is mine; I am the landlord, and my claim upon the contents of these
      apartments takes precedence of yours. I think it does&mdash;I say I
      believe it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you <i>are</i> the landlord?&rdquo; said Mr. Jukes, eyeing him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can prove that, Jukes,&rdquo; said the owner of the white whiskers. &ldquo;You know
      me, Jukes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Mr. Graba,&rdquo; responded Jukes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Gomer&rsquo;s agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a sworn broker,&rdquo; added Nathan Gomer. &ldquo;Not less than one hundred
      pounds is owing to me for rent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo; asked Jukes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve months,&rdquo; replied Nathan Gomer. &ldquo;Mr. Wilton rented the whole house,
      and has not paid me the last year&rsquo;s rent. There is not more than enough
      here to satisfy my claim. I think so&mdash;I say I believe there is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; gruffly muttered Jukes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Produce your warrant of execution upon these goods, Mr. Graba!&rdquo; said Mr.
      Nathan Gomer. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find it formal and proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps <i>you&rsquo;d</i> like to look at it?&rdquo; said Mr. Jukes to Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Gomer looked at him with inquiring eyes, and watched him read every
      word in the document with careful attention from the first to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had ended his perusal, Nathan Gomer smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing informal or contrary to law there?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Charley with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is dreadful!&rdquo; murmured Lotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, however, was not further distressed&mdash;at least she displayed no
      additional grief at this new incident. She had, in fact, been so stunned
      and overwhelmed by the first event of the morning&mdash;that which
      involved the compulsory absence of her father&mdash;that any circumstance
      of a minor description could neither add to nor diminish her sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Gomer turned to Mr. Jukes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;and you may take your myrmidons with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And return the writ to the sheriff with nully bony on it, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mr. Jukes, chagrined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you please,&rdquo; returned Nathan; &ldquo;my name, if it suits you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thank ye. Your name will be handed in to Messrs. Squeege and Drain,
      solicitors, Old Jewry,&rdquo; replied Jukes, with a most significant nod of the
      head, which implied a threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do as well,&rdquo; said Nathan; &ldquo;they know me; they stand indebted to
      me in a good round sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nether jaw of Jukes slightly dropped; he gave a steadfast look at
      Nathan Gomer; his eyes then slowly ran round the room, and settled on
      Flora, who, pale as marble, stood as though she were in a trance, all
      unconscious of what was passing around her. He gazed at her thoughtfully
      for a moment. A sudden flash illumined his eyes, indicating that a new
      idea had taken possession of him, and then he turned to his followers and
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Sudds; come along, Nutty, Good day, Mr. Gomer; it&rsquo;s your turn
      this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day&mdash;good day, Jukes&mdash;as you say, I think it is my turn
      this time&mdash;I believe I may say it is my turn this time,&rdquo; answered
      Nathan, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jukes hastened out of the room, closely attended by his satellites,
      Nutty looking especially chop-fallen, as his possession money would in all
      probability be returned &ldquo;nully bony&rdquo; as well as the writ.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these men had fairly slammed the street-door after them, and the
      sound had risen up through the house, Nathan Gomer, who had listened
      attentively for it, surveyed the persons of both Charley and Lotte, and
      then addressing Flora, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wilton, are these young persons friends of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora, upon hearing her name, started and slightly shuddered, as one
      rousing from a painful reverie: Lotte gave her no time to answer, for she
      said hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir; new friends, it is true; but not the less, disposed warmly
      to serve her in her present terrible affliction, so far as our humble
      means will permit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what are your means?&rdquo; demanded Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte for a moment hung her head, and a bright flush mounted to her cheek
      and forehead, then she flung up her face, and with her clear bright eyes
      looked steadfastly at the little old man with the golden visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few rapid words she sketched the position of herself and her brother,
      and the bright, youthful, sanguine hopes they both entertained of their
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo Lotte&mdash;well said, my pet!&rdquo; cried Charley, patting her
      affectionately and approvingly upon the shoulder. &ldquo;And as for what I can
      do, why somehow I&rsquo;ll see you through it; a book or two less, and a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       dinner, he was about to say, but he checked himself and substituted&mdash;&ldquo;a
      pleasure the fewer I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t miss, and I would not forego the happiness of
      witnessing your gratification at being able to serve a friend in distress,
      for something far beyond such sacrifices as those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Nathan Gomer to Lotte. &ldquo;Your eighteen-pence a day, for
      eighteen hours at cap-front making&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two shillings sometimes!&rdquo; she interposed, boastfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two shillings always, if you will,&rdquo; continued Nathan, &ldquo;gives you no
      margin for doing anything but starving and slaving, if you pay your way&mdash;and
      you, my friend&rdquo; he added, turning to Charley, &ldquo;if you have made up your
      mind to achieve to the bar, have not a farthing to waste upon even the
      luxury of seeing your sister destroy herself, in an attempt to accomplish
      a feat which is not only impracticable, but impossible. No, no; go on as
      you have been going on, and let us see what time will bring forth.&rdquo; He
      paused, and then after running his eye over the warrant, he addressed
      Flora, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Wilton, I place this warrant in your keeping&mdash;impressing
      upon you that you must always have it in your possession in safe custody,
      except when you leave home for a short time, then you must entrust it to
      some friend who will hold it here until your return. So long as you do
      this, no person like Jukes can disturb or remove your furniture. You will
      keep it until you see me again, or until you hear from me. I am a stranger
      to you, not prepossessing in my appearance, but I am not quite so
      hard-hearted as I have been represented to be, nor quite so selfish in my
      nature as you may hereafter be led to believe. Now mark what I say. You
      have been left in a position of great trust in the midst of a heavy
      calamity; much will be demanded of your energy and self reliance; remember
      &lsquo;God helps those who help themselves&rsquo;, therefore, while you are grateful
      for, place no reliance in, promises. Farewell!&mdash;we shall meet again.
      May it be when you will not need my assistance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of the hand, he hurried out of the room, closely followed by
      Mr. Graba, leaving Flora, no less than Lotte, in a state of bewildered
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the girls had seen Nathan Gomer before, and his sudden
      appearance, together with the power he had assumed, and the kindness,
      which in a cold abrupt manner he had displayed, completely astounded them;
      they knew not what to make of it, nor, so far as Lotte was concerned, how
      to talk enough about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though she talked briskly, she acted smartly, and rousing Flora into
      action, proceeded to &ldquo;put things straight,&rdquo; and to render the aspect of
      the place pretty much what it had been before Mr. Jukes made his most
      unwelcome appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her and Flora to the task to which they had devoted themselves,
      let us follow the movements of Nathan Gomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood alone at the door of Mr. Grahame in the Regent&rsquo;s Park, very
      shortly after he had quitted Wilton&rsquo;s residence, and he sent in his card,
      in a rather peremptory manner, by the same individual who had announced
      Mr. Chewkle. He took no heed of the representations made to him that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grahame were engaged, and when he were engaged, his instructions was
      that no person should be admitted to interrupt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him my card&mdash;he&rsquo;ll see <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Nathan, emphatically.
      &ldquo;If you refuse,&rdquo; he added, as the man hesitated, &ldquo;I will walk up into the
      library where you say he is engaged with some one, and obtain your
      dismissal by acquainting your master with your refusal to announce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the manner of Nathan that Whelks, the head footman,
      did not approve of, especially as he felt himself overawed by it, in spite
      of the affront to which he was called upon to submit. It was evident that
      in the eyes of the little visitor his importance was sadly underrated, and
      that he should have to put in his pocket the threat of dismissal which had
      been held out to him, and which, though he turned his nose up at it,
      caused him to take the card and proceed into the library, as the word &ldquo;<i>forgery</i>&rdquo;
       issued from his master&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no heed of it, for his mind was filled with Nathan Gomer&mdash;not
      favourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir! he exclaimed, in the affected strain he usually adopted when
      addressing his master, &ldquo;ther is a pesson below&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you, scoundrel, intrude, when I am especially and privately
      engaged with any gentleman?&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, leaping to his feet and
      speaking passionately, while his eyes sparkled with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whelks started back, and his wig sent up a small cloud of flour. He was so
      startled by the sudden action of Mr. Grahame, that he could hear his own
      heart beat against his ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask pardon, sir,&rdquo; he faltered out, &ldquo;but the pesson below&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse the person below!&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, forgetting in his rage that
      dignified pride which never permitted an ebullition of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whelks heartily echoed the sentiment, but dared not so express himself&mdash;he
      only bowed affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not repeatedly told you, sir,&rdquo; continued Mr. Grahame, sternly,
      &ldquo;that I will only be seen by those of whom I have some knowledge, or whom
      I desire to see? Another infringement of my order, and you shall be
      summarily dismissed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It struck Whelks that his master spoke in much the same strain when he saw
      Chewkle; he, therefore, handed to him Nathan&rsquo;s card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame snatched the card from the salver, on which Whelks presented
      it, and on reading it, passed his hand over his face to hide any emotion
      which might betray itself. He sank down into his chair, and laid himself
      back, plunged in intense thought. Then he looked at the card, and appeared
      to read it a dozen times. At length he turned to Whelks, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! say I shall be happy to have the honour of receiving this gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whelks, with an expression of surprise on a countenance incapable of
      displaying any very distinct phase of emotion, descended to the hall to
      obey his commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chewkle,&rdquo; said Mr. Grahame, when Whelks had disappeared, &ldquo;may I ask
      you to favour me by stepping into this chamber for a few minutes? My
      visitor&mdash;a very wealthy and distinguished person, I assure you&mdash;will
      not detain me long, and then I shall have the pleasure of renewing our
      important conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle expressed his happiness at having the opportunity of obliging
      Mr. Grahame in any fashion, and promptly dived into a small room
      overlooking the park, and connected with the library. He heard Mr. Grahame
      lock the door, securing him in his little retreat, but he carefully placed
      his ear to the keyhole, in anticipation of picking up something worth
      hearing and retaining&mdash;if he was paid handsomely for secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame had scarcely resumed his seat when Nathan Gomer entered the
      library. He returned the bow, graciously performed, with which he was
      greeted, and placing his hat and gloves upon a chair, seated himself upon
      another, and commenced speaking in rather a louder key than Mr. Grahame
      thought quite desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grahame,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;we have not met before, but you are not
      unacquainted with my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no&mdash;of course it is most familiar to me,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or my money?&rdquo; continued Nathan Gomer. &ldquo;Assuredly not,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Grahame, a little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made me fresh proposals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a short term&mdash;I hope you understand that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. But I want to know upon what foundation you base your
      expectation of returning the sums demanded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole, sole, entire possession of an enormous property; vast estates,
      yielding a splendid income, and a very considerable amount in cash, the
      accumulation of years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in Chancery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A link is wanting, I think, to perfect your claim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear sir, a mere nothing&mdash;such as it is, we are prepared to
      supply it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You are, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite clear about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing was ever more certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem! That is satisfactory, to be sure; but stay, is there not another
      person who has something to do with it?&mdash;one&mdash;one&mdash;dear me,
      what is his name!&mdash;one&mdash;&mdash;Pshaw! how absurd in me to forget
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no person, save myself, Mr. Gomer, who has the shadow of a
      claim to any portion of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have been misinformed. I was given to understand that a person
      named&mdash;named&mdash;I do not often forget names&mdash;cannot you help
      me, Mr. Grahame, to the name of the individual who claims the property of
      which you have spoken, as well as you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;I, sir-no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said with an air of offended dignity, and the manner of a man
      who, having made a positive assertion, sees that it is doubted, and wishes
      it to be thought that the incredulity is unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glittering eye of Nathan Gomer seemed to play over every feature of
      Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s countenance. Suddenly he said, with startling abruptness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I remember it. I have it. Wilton is the name. Wilton, who follows the
      occupation of a gold-plate chaser. Has he not a claim&mdash;also wanting a
      link&mdash;to this property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have been fancy, but the sound of a whistle appeared to issue
      from the vicinity of a key-hole in the door of the ante-chamber
      overlooking the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilton! Wilton!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, assuming an air of reflection, to
      hide his embarrassment. &ldquo;Wilton! no, oh no! I know nothing of any such
      claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the man himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gold-worker, living in Clerkenwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Where is Clerkenwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem! ugh! ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Gomer was seized with a cough. He rose up, took his hat and gloves,
      and put them on with slow precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      His glittering eye once more perused every feature in Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grahame,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;you shall hear from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Grahame, rubbing his
      hands. &ldquo;Let me hope in a manner agreeable to my wishes and in accordance
      with your known liberality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be one of two things, Mr. Grahame: either to comply with your
      proposition, or to issue process for the recovery of the money now due by
      you to me. Good morning, Mr. Grahame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to glide out of the room down the staircase, and presented
      himself at the elbow of Whelks, before that personage had any conception
      that his services were required to show out the &ldquo;little yellow ob-jek,
      which,&rdquo; he was just informing the hall-porter, &ldquo;he had a few minutes
      before shown in to the libree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a sharp, shrill, tone, Nathan requested to be let out, and &lsquo;Whelks,
      taking upon himself the duty of the inert porter, threw open the
      street-door wide, and closed it with a loud bang, thankful, he knew not
      wherefore, that the &ldquo;yaller objek&rdquo; was out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame looked after Nathan as he moved rapidly but noiselessly down
      the stairs, and returned into the library, feeling that the interview had
      been of a very unsatisfactory character. He experienced an uneasy
      impression with respect to the inquiries made by Nathan Gomer respecting
      Wilton. He cursed the name of the old gold-chaser; but for him he might be
      in secure possession of the wealth he coveted, and which&mdash;there was
      no disguising it&mdash;he imperatively needed. The man&rsquo;s obstinacy, while
      it did not benefit himself, was very likely to send him, Grahame, headlong
      to ruin for want of&mdash;what? Only a signature&mdash;a simple signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! Chewkle&rsquo;s suggestion flashed through his brain. It was but to attach a
      name to a bond: who would know that he had done it but Chewkle? and would
      not money buy any man&rsquo;s tongue? With Chewkle&rsquo;s aid it might be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who else could know it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilton, starving, dying, in prison, shattered by grief, want, and toil;
      his children outcasts in the streets, driven, perhaps, into dens of
      infamy, how could they prosecute a claim against him? If they did, should
      he not have the wealth to defeat every such attempt? could he not buy off
      or suborn all witnesses against him? The possessions and the money he
      should acquire by that single signature would enable him to cope with the
      most greedy demands for bearing false witness. Shallow reasoning enough,
      but conclusive in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His train of thought having conducted him to this point, the fact that he
      had Chewkle locked up in the small ante-chamber overlooking the park,
      presented itself. Had the man overheard what had transpired between him
      and Nathan Gomer? A flush of heat crossed his brow at the supposition. For
      the moment he forgot all the dictates of his pride, lost utterly his
      austere bearing, and crept on tip-toe to the door of the little chamber.
      He softly removed the key, and peered through the keyhole, but without
      catching sight of Mr. Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced the key without a sound, and turning the well-oiled lock
      noiselessly, he flung the door open suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle, with his arms folded, was standing in a contemplative
      attitude, gazing out of the window, and watching the sportive movements of
      some wild fowl upon the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem! a&mdash;Mr. Chewkle, I am at liberty now!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame,
      recovering his pompous manner, and feeling convinced that his conference
      with Nathan Gomer had not been overheard by the commission agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle professed himself to be quite ready to proceed to business,
      and begged Mr. Grahame, when he made apologies for detaining him while he
      transacted important matters, not to mention it. Indeed, there was no
      necessity, as Chewkle&rsquo;s quick ear, applied in the right place, had heard
      every word that passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the poor old fool, Wilton, continues obstinate, does he?&rdquo;
       exclaimed Grahame to Chewkle, when they were both seated.&ldquo;&rsquo;Ard as
      hadamant,&rdquo; returned Mr. Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is only doing himself harm,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nobody else no good,&rdquo; added Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly is not acting in a manner to entitle him to consideration,&rdquo;
       observed Mr. Grahame, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; responded Mr. Chewkle; &ldquo;nothen is to be got out of &rsquo;is
      sort; you may as well try to get butter out o&rsquo; flint; so if I was you,
      sir, I should just say nothen to anybody&mdash;but me&mdash;and go an&rsquo; do
      it at once&mdash;now&rsquo;s a good time&mdash;by-and-by never comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame grew cold and white, and his teeth chattered. <i>FORGERY!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tremendous act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punishment, penal servitude for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the words rang in his ears!
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment more, and the threat of Nathan Gomer boomed through his brain
      like the minute guns of a ship of war announcing an approaching execution.
      &ldquo;Issue process for the recovery of the money now due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shivered as though he had come out of a cold spring bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed his trembling fingers upon the handle of a drawer, and opened
      it. He turned over some papers, and drew forth a letter. It bore the
      signature, &ldquo;E. Wilton,&rdquo; in a bold hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is his handwriting,&rdquo; he said to Chewkle, in a hoarse voice, and
      with a sickly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my wig!&rdquo; said Mr. Chewkle, as he gazed on it with admiring eyes. &ldquo;A
      prime clear sort of writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his pocket a parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Grahame, with chattering teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The</i> deed that Wilton wouldn&rsquo;t sign,&rdquo; responded Chewkle. &ldquo;Have you
      got a piece of thin paper?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame, with a beating heart and trembling hand, gave him half a
      sheet of thin post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will just do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then put his hand into his side pocket and produced a small phial
      containing a thin fluid with a pink tinge; he produced a camel-hair
      pencil, and, steeping it in the liquid, painted over the back of that
      portion of the note which contained the signature of Wilton. Mr. Grahame,
      with eyes starting out of their sockets, watched him without breathing.
      After waiting for a minute, he examined Wilton&rsquo;s sign-manual carefully,
      and then laying it upon the thin paper which he had previously damped, he
      slightly burnished the back, and there appeared upon the thin paper the
      signature of Wilton reversed. This he, in turn, laid upon the deed, on the
      place for the name of the person signing the deed to appear, and again
      using the burnisher with more firmness, he reproduced, though somewhat
      faintly, the name of Wilton upon the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he to Mr. Grahame, &ldquo;there it is; you have only to mark over it
      carefully, and the name will be there with such exactness the man himself
      couldn&rsquo;t swear it wasn&rsquo;t his&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do it, my good friend Chewkle&mdash;you take the pen and write over
      it,&rdquo; gasped Grahame, convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I beg your pardon, I think I&rsquo;ve done a good deal. The winnings
      will be yourn, and yourn must be the venter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my hand trembles so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ring for a little brandy&mdash;that will put you to rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I cannot do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You know the konsequences o&rsquo; not doin&rsquo; it best, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the pen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;mind, gently does it!&rdquo; advised Mr. Chewkle. &ldquo;&rsquo;Old
      your pen &rsquo;ard with your thum&rsquo; and press it against your middle
      finger top, and then you&rsquo;ll mark it firmly. Steady she goes&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      it&mdash;beautiful! Dot that <i>hi&mdash;l, t, o, n</i>&mdash;good! Now
      for that little bit o&rsquo; flourish&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;it&rsquo;s done, an&rsquo;
      capitally you&rsquo;ve done the <i>FORGERY!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame uttered a groan, and sank back in his chair. Mr. Chewkle
      caught him with a sudden grip by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a dreadful secret I have of yourn,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;let me &rsquo;int
      to you that you&rsquo;ll have to be generous to me to make me keep it dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! witness of my infamy, your most avaricious wishes shall be
      gratified,&rdquo; hissed Mr. Grahame through his teeth. &ldquo;You have only to be
      silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the grave,&rdquo; said Chewkle, placing his finger to his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mr. Grahame uttered a shout of horror: his eye fell upon Nathan
      Gomer, who, a few paces from him, was standing watching him attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Mr. Gomer&mdash;how&mdash;what&mdash;why are you here?&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle, in an instant, spread a newspaper, which was on the table, over
      the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not alarm yourself, Mr. Grahame,&rdquo; replied Nathan Gomer, with the
      coolest self-possession. &ldquo;I merely returned to say, after a brief
      reflection, that I have decided on entertaining your proposals. You had
      better, therefore, put your solicitor in connection with mine. Good
      morning, Mr. Grahame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nathan&rsquo;s eye glittered on Chewkle for an instant, so as to make that
      person feel most uncomfortable. Then he moved swiftly and noiselessly out
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame, pale as death, sank back in his chair. Mr. Chewkle gazed in
      the direction which Nathan Gomer had taken, and ejaculated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo;

    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he events of the
      morning in which he had taken so prominent a part presented to Hal Vivian,
      when alone in his chamber, that evening, rather a wide field for
      contemplation. He was glad of the opportunity which the close of the day&rsquo;s
      labour gave him to retire to the solitude of his neatly furnished bedroom,
      because, unobserved, he could there review the circumstances which had
      that day occurred, and give to them the colouring most agreeable to the
      feelings which had recently taken possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself into an easy chair, and was quickly engaged in drawing
      deductions. Not for a second was the fair face of Flora absent from his
      vision. The rugged visage of Jukes, the grimy features of his satellites,
      the impassible countenance of Nathan Gomer, which seemed moulded out of
      fine gold, the bright, frank aspect of Lotte, by turns floated across his
      mental speculum, but never to displace that of Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the past a future was to be formed; he tried to construct it, and
      in doing so set himself honestly to work to examine those feelings which
      prompted him so strongly to undertake the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to understand why he should interest himself at all in the
      affairs of the old gold-worker; what motives should have induced him to
      interfere and take part in what had happened that morning, or why he
      should be so very eager to effect certain happy results he had in
      contemplation, and the answer which constantly presented itself to these
      and other questions was&mdash;Flora Wilton!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal Vivian was just out of his time; but a few days, and his&mdash; <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">Seven long years were out. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at that age in man when love partakes very strongly of the
      imaginative, and clothes the object of affection with an excellence and
      perfection which, though it be not always just, makes her whom he loves to
      him a <i>beau ideal.</i> Almost every youth creates in his mind a standard
      of perfect loveliness, and if he, perchance, meets with a face which
      presents some resemblance to the mental image he has formed, he at once
      proceeds to invest it with all the charms with which he has endowed the
      unreal. The maid is elected to the first place in his heart&mdash;she
      becomes his guiding influence&mdash;he busies himself by contemplating
      schemes of impossible delights for her, is anxious to be at her side
      whenever apart, and most loth, when with her, to tear himself from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt a very considerable amount of mental deception is practised
      during this phase of youthful existence, and when marriage has bestowed
      upon the lovesick swain the object he has so ardently coveted, he perhaps
      finds that he has been gazing through, what he now considers, the wrong
      end of the telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Vivian was, however, like all youths of his age, in no condition to
      believe that the being he had made his representative angel could ever
      prove the reverse. He had always seen her mild and gentle, soft in manner,
      courteous in speech, amiable in expression, and exquisitely lovely in
      person. He could suppose no other side to the picture, and so, as she
      outwardly resembled an angel, he gave her credit for being inwardly a
      saint. His intimacy with her was slight, his opportunities of seeing her&mdash;save
      during the past year, when he had made them&mdash;had not been many; he
      had interchanged but few words with her, and they were of a very
      commonplace description. He had not hitherto thought of her, more than
      that she was a girl of rare and delicate beauty, whose features he should
      like to reproduce in some of the choice modellings of the precious metals
      entrusted to him, for it seemed to him that no artist, however marvellous
      his skill in delineating the female face divine, had ever succeeded in
      producing one so beautiful as her&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love had, however, taken no part in this admiration; he had gazed upon her
      and thought of her as he would have done of the best efforts of the
      greatest masters of art&mdash;&ldquo;a thing of beauty,&rdquo; but animated with life.
      Her sudden appearance at the window, the golden sunbeams falling on her
      face, her hair, her light dress, bringing her beauty out in strong relief
      from the dark chamber in which she stood, altered at one stroke the
      condition of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passion sprang into life simultaneously with the glance he turned upon her&mdash;it
      intermingled with his admiration, and became love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not conscious of the change wrought within him when he
      instinctively surmised that trouble and trial hovered over her, and that
      he should take an active part in endeavouring to avert it. He had not a
      notion of it even when seated with Mr. Harper, his uncle, discoursing on
      the position of the Wilton family, he employed himself devising how the
      all but orphaned child of their skilled workman might be rescued from
      destitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in his chamber, alone in deep meditation and self-examination, it
      flashed through his mind. A sudden glow of heat pervaded his frame, and he
      sprang to his feet impulsively&mdash;a strange tremor thrilled through him&mdash;a
      feeling of apprehension crept over him&mdash;and a species of sadness
      oppressed him; wherefore, he could not comprehend. Here was food for
      contemplation, indeed; and he resumed his seat to pursue this new subject
      through its many ramifications until he should arrive at some kind of
      ultimate result.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fact followed from this discovery made by him. Up to this moment he
      had been, in his knowledge of the world, a mere boy. He was, at a moment,
      transformed into a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had &ldquo;something to love,&rdquo; and the affection was not of the same nature
      as that entertained for kith or kin. He had taken up a responsibility, and
      at once there was something to live for, work for, seek for, and to win.
      Fame, wealth, honour, were now worth striving to gain, because there was
      one, whose approbation he coveted, to share the wealth and honour to be
      secured by persevering energy and untiring ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In commencing his struggle with the world, here was an incentive to
      ambition beyond a mere love of art or the desire to excel, and a motive
      for reaping golden opinions beyond the common wish to become rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true there was nothing in Flora&rsquo;s manner to lead him to believe that
      he had created any such impression upon her as she had upon him, and the
      probabilities were that she did not see him in any other light than as a
      gentlemanly and good-hearted young man, who had been kind and considerate
      to her father in business, and singularly generous and friendly to her in
      her moment of trial. All this he quite understood; and, though he felt
      himself over head and ears in love with her, he did not deceive himself
      into any other notion than that to win her love his work was yet to
      commence, to be prosecuted with faithful perseverance, and in an honorable
      and unselfish spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As true love looks to marriage as its goal, so did that possessed by Hal;
      but romantic, generous, and noble-hearted as he was by nature, he had yet
      so much of the common leaven in him that it struck him it would be worth
      consideration to ascertain into what kind of family he should introduce
      himself by an alliance with Miss Wilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own position was very soon determined. He was the son of a deceased
      sister of Mr. Harper, the goldsmith&mdash;was apprenticed to him, and
      would, in all probability, be his heir, as his only son had turned out
      wild in his youth, and had, after the commission of some outrageous piece
      of profligacy, disappeared. It was supposed he had fled to India, but from
      his departure to the present hour he had not been heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harper had mentioned to Hal an intention that he had formed, of taking
      him into partnership with him, but he had decided first on subjecting him
      to a probation of a year or two, to try whether the promise of steadiness
      and sobriety, which his youth had given, would be realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal&rsquo;s future might, consequently, be said to be formed for him; and it was
      into his uncle&rsquo;s family he should introduce Miss Wilton as his wife, if
      ever the union took place. Therefore, while considering his own happiness,
      he felt it to be his duty not to overlook that of his uncle, who had
      behaved to him from his infancy as a tender, just, and generous father. It
      would be a task he should impose upon himself, to ascertain, as far as
      possible, the previous history of old Wilton. Not that he feared the
      result would turn out other than he could wish, but he could not conceal
      from himself that there was a mystery hanging over the old worker in gold,
      which it would be proper, if possible, to penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years back Wilton had suddenly presented himself at the shop of Mr.
      Harper for employment in carving in gold. Inquiries elicited that he had
      not been bred to the business he professed, but was what might be termed a
      scientific amateur. Mr. Harper was struck by his language, and by his
      remarks upon the processes and art of modelling and chasing; and being
      much pressed at the time with an excess of business, he entrusted him with
      some valuable work&mdash;the more readily when he found that old Wilton
      resided exactly opposite to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilton returned with his task accomplished in a manner greatly to Mr.
      Harper&rsquo;s satisfaction, and from that time he had been employed by him. He
      always executed his work excellently, but he was not always punctual, and
      twice or thrice Mr. Harper, in anger, had threatened to discontinue
      employing him; but Wilton generally contrived to smooth away his
      irritation, and they went on as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was known of him&mdash;whence, or when, or how, he came he seldom
      went out, and only worked for Mr. Harper. So much Hal knew&mdash;no one
      knew more&mdash;and yet they do know a good deal about each other in
      Clerkenwell. Hal resolved now that his knowledge should not sleep here,
      although at the present moment he could not see quite clearly his way to
      learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      His future cogitations were terminated by a call to supper, and that meal
      being discussed, he retired to rest&mdash;to think again, as before, and
      to fall into a deep, heavy slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he met with Flora in some leafy coppice and in secret, and
      that, while conversing with her in a strain of loving tenderness, they
      were interrupted by the tramp of a body of persons approaching. He fancied
      that he seized Flora in his arms, and fled with her, but was pursued, and
      that his pursuers shouted and uttered fierce threats. He looked back, and
      saw that old Wilton headed Jukes and his followers, as well as Nathan
      Gomer and his uncle, who seemed to be the most excited of the party, and
      called him by name loudly. Then, as he still fled, he observed that his
      pursuers were armed, and he heard his uncle call to them to fire upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fled on; still his uncle&rsquo;s voice shouted in his ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire! fire! fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last he sprang up in his bed, suddenly awakened, and still the voice
      vehemently cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire! fire! fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy hand beat violently against the panels of his chamber-door, and
      completely aroused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once leaped to the floor, and unlocked his door. He found his uncle
      without, in a state of great excitement&mdash;he was half-dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I thought you would never wake; there is a fire;
      throw on your clothes, Hal, my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fire! where?&rdquo; asked Hal, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the way,&rdquo; returned Mr. Harper; &ldquo;be quick! while I pacify your aunt,
      who is frightened to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit Hal&rsquo;s candle as he spoke, and shuffled hastily away in his
      slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the way! Why Wilton&rsquo;s house was over the way. Hal felt his blood rush
      violently through his veins. Over the way! What if it should be there? He
      drew on his clothes with hasty swiftness, and he heard the low, hoarse
      sounds of a gathering mob in the streets. The tramp of running feet, the
      violent knocking at doors, and the shouts of boys and men crying &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that was absolutely essential to wear, but nothing that would impede
      his activity or application of strength, did Hal put on, and then he
      hurried to one of the front windows of the house and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the sudden and violent shock that ran through
      his frame. Though he had thought it possible, he had not believed it
      probable that it could be Wilton&rsquo;s abode which was on fire, yet his first
      glance told him that the lower part of that house was in flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mob had gathered round; an active policeman was pushing it about to
      clear the way for the inhabitants to bring out their furniture from the
      burning house&mdash;that is, if they had a chance to do aught beyond
      saving their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the house was open, and volumes of smoke were pouring forth. A
      dull red flame, throwing a ruby glare, was to be seen gleaming through the
      windows of the kitchen and the parlour. The upper part of the house seemed
      lost in wreathing dull, gray, cloudy masses of vapour, which rolled up
      from the seat of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising up above the hoarse roar of the assembled mob, came the shouts of
      those who were on their way with the first engine. It seemed to be the
      herald of succour, but, alas! it was only the parish-engine, brought up by
      an energetic beadle, four men, and about twenty dirty ragged boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turncock arrived with it, and he, though able in the daylight to find
      the plug-hole blindfold, could not without great difficulty discover it,
      with his eyes briskly exercised, at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At lengthy when the parish engine, bravely foremost in the rank, was
      ready, a mass of volunteers sprang forward to pump it. Mr. Turncock
      succeeded in pulling up the plug, and saturating a dozen venturesome
      persons, who with engineering spirits watched the operation. The hose of
      the parish-engine was at once connected with the stream of water, and with
      a hurrah the volunteers began to work the handles of the pump, but though
      they were made to sound jar-jar, jar-jar, jar-jar, briskly, nothing came
      of it. The parish-engine, as it has ever been from the hour it was first
      invented to the present time, was found to be practicably useless. No
      water could be forced into the directing pipe to play upon the burning
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flames grew fiercer, the smoke denser, and crackling sounds of wood
      splitting, and the sputtering of sparks, were more distinctly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was suddenly a mighty cry from the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the upper windows appeared, shrieking for aid, the forms of two young
      girls. They were in their night dresses, and had evidently only just been
      aroused. Three or four brave young fellows rushed into the passage of the
      house to ascend the stairs to save them, but a sheet of flame suddenly
      leaped forth, and drove them back scorched. Thus victorious, it seized the
      staircase in its blistering embrace, and hissed and sputtered as it danced
      and darted upwards, cutting off with a species of savage joy all means of
      egress by that route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouts were raised for the fire-escape, as the attempting rescuers were
      forced back by the blinding burst of flame into the streets, and
      preparations were made, if the worst came to the worst, to receive with as
      much safety as possible those who would be called upon to leap from the
      dizzy heights of the upper floor as a last desperate resort to save their
      otherwise doomed lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distant hubbub, growing louder as it drew near, announced the approach
      of the fire-escape. Its advent was hailed with lusty shouts, and fifty
      volunteers rushed to facilitate its arrival, but impeding and retarding
      its progress in their meritorious desire to get it up to the scene of
      disaster as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the state of things when Hal looked out of window to ascertain
      where the fire had broken out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A downward glance at the rolling masses of smoke, and intermittent flashes
      of forked flame; an upward glance at the windows, where, huddled together,
      were the shrinking, weeping, distracted females, and he was the next
      minute in front of the house making a mad attempt to ascend the burning
      staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serpent-tongued fire had, however, obtained complete possession; it
      roared, and licked as it roared, every particle of woodwork within its
      reach, brightening up as if with ferocious glee as it gained strength, and
      sending forth showers of coruscations, sparkling and glittering, seemingly
      to mark as a festive occasion one of the most dreadful visitations to
      which human society is occasionally subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinded and suffocated, Hal was compelled to give back, to save the life
      which might yet be successfully employed in rescuing that of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached the doorway, the fire-escape came up, the conductor placed
      it against the wall; but before he could commence his perilous ascent, a
      light, youthful figure sprang past him on to the wheel, caught in his
      hands the nearest rundle of the ladder, and ran lightly upwards, followed
      by a cheer from the mob and a shout from the conductor to come down again;
      for inexperience, no matter how honorably influenced, is, in most cases, a
      sad marplot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such emergencies, surrounded by frightful danger, exposed to fatal
      consequences by a false step or an error in judgment, the safety of
      valuable lives hanging upon a thread, experience allied to calmness, and
      cool self-reliance under the most trying contingencies, is essential to
      successful operation. In these cases, knowledge is indeed power. To know
      how to act and when to act, what to use and how to use it, with the
      necessary courage to do and dare all that may be required, is the battle,
      and victory rarely fails to follow it when it is properly conducted. It
      can be understood, therefore, why the conductor of the fire-escape, who
      had saved many lives, enraged at the act of Hal Vivian, shouted so
      vehemently to him to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew by many instances that such a proceeding as that of which the
      youth was guilty, while it imperilled the rescue of those sought to be
      saved, added to the number he was called upon to preserve. His own life
      was always in jeopardy in the performance of his duty, to which he was
      quite equal, and it was vexing to find another placing himself in peril
      without occasion for it, and, in all probability, doing far more harm than
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as he was in his chase after Hal, he failed to reach him before he
      was at the window, where clustered the affrighted girls. Ere he could
      clutch hold of him, Hal sprang on the window-sill, and was the next
      instant in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was recognised immediately by those whom he came to deliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, as she saw Hal&rsquo;s form upon the edge of the window, and witnessed
      him bound into the room, uttered a cry of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the light from the street flashed upon his animated excited
      countenance, her heart received upon it the impression of a face it was
      not likely to permit easily to be effaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven reward you, Mr. Vivian!&rdquo; she exclaimed, hysterically, &ldquo;you have
      come to save us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perish with you!&rdquo; he replied, excitedly, &ldquo;for I will not leave the
      room until you are all safely down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you! God bless you!&rdquo; sobbed Lotte Clinton, who, as white as
      death, was trembling like an aspen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, young fellow,&rdquo; cried the conductor, putting his head into the
      window, &ldquo;since you are here, you must make yourself useful, and be as cool
      as a cowcumber. Recollect, we ain&rsquo;t here to spend a week. Shut that door;
      look sharp, or you&rsquo;ll all be stifled in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner commanded than done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant the clattering of horses&rsquo; feet at full gallop over the
      ringing stones, the heavy rumble of whirling wheels, the rattling cheers
      of a mob which was fast growing into a multitude, announced the arrival of
      the first practicable fire-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Lotte was placed within the cradle of the fire-escape, and
      was safely lowered down to those beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar of gratification burst from the lips of the spectators as they
      beheld one added to the list of the saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal watched until Lotte was lifted out of the escape, and then he turned
      to Flora, to request her to be in readiness to take her place in the
      little life-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be understood that these operations were performed with the utmost
      rapidity consistent with safety. The room was more than half filled by a
      dense smoke when Hal entered; and, although the door was since closed, it
      had streamed in through crannies and chinks so as to fill it&mdash;the
      open window rather holding it in the room than suffering it to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lotte and her companion, the conductor of the fire-escape departed,
      the atmosphere had become heated and stifling. It was also so thick that
      scarcely a thing a foot off could be distinguished. Hal&rsquo;s astonishment and
      alarm can be imagined when, on the return of the cradle, he spoke to Flora
      and received no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a moment past and she was at his elbow; she was now gone&mdash;he
      could not see her&mdash;he called to her, but received no reply. He felt
      about the room, but he was nearly suffocated, without succeeding in
      finding her. He heard the roaring of the flames beneath him: the smoke
      grew each moment thicker and denser: large drops of perspiration poured
      from him: instinctively he cowered to the floor and spread his hands in
      all directions, afraid to open his mouth for fear of being stifled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor of the fire-escape now poked his head into the window, and
      shouted for the pair to save their lives while they had a chance, but he
      received no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped into the room, and threw himself on the floor, groping about
      upon his hands and knees. He uttered a shrill cry, but met with no
      response. He persevered as long as he could breathe, but without meeting
      the bodies of either the youth or the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his impression that, overpowered by the smoke they had sunk
      senseless upon the floor, but he could nowhere find them, and at last
      mystified, and all but suffocated, he was compelled to retreat to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was at the door of the room, shooting its long forks of flame
      into the old wood of which it was composed, and with such intense heat,
      that it was quickly one mass of flame, and sputtering sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy heart, the conductor got out of the room, on to his machine,
      and he was barely upon it, when a long blast of flame followed him with
      the speed of lightning, and darted out of both windows, cracking and
      smashing the fragile glass panes, causing them to fly in all directions,
      playing fantastically over, and wreathing up the architraves of the
      windows, lighting up as it did so the excited faces of the swaying,
      yelling mob below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor slid down the escape, and communicated the appalling
      intelligence, that in the burning rooms above were two miserable young
      creatures who, by the time he was relating the occurrence, had become
      shapeless, blackened, charred masses of human clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene had now grown intensely exciting; more engines had arrived, and
      hundreds of persons were added to those already assembled. A body of
      policemen were employed in forcing the turbulent crowd back, so as to give
      the firemen room for their exertions. The street was turned into a river,
      and the fire brigade&mdash;accoutred like the heavy dragoons of a former
      period&mdash;were plashing through the muddy stream, getting their engines
      into working order with the systematic, and, as it appeared to the anxious
      gazers, the rather apathetic regularity of organised action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantic occupiers of adjoining houses were flinging out their furniture&mdash;their
      little all, and that uninsured. The beds and chairs, tables and drawers,
      formed, as they were brought, or thrown, hastily into the streets, a
      motley jumble&mdash;some of them being borne away by active parties, never
      more to be returned to the original owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two persons burned to death!&rdquo; was a cry which ran through the crowd, and
      was again and again re-echoed by the individuals of which it was formed, a
      thrill of horror accompanying it wherever it went.
    </p>
    <p>
      An explosion, and up shot a body of flame into the air, attended by a
      shower of sparks, fragments of burning wood, and flaming articles, the
      volumes of smoke, of gold and rose-blush tint rolling away, painfully
      contrasting with the violet-hued heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roof was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant glare was thrown over all objects, far and near, making the
      place around as light as day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo! a sudden and tremendous cry burst from the agitated multitude,
      pressing, crowding, and crushing upon the foot and roadways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there!&mdash;look there!&rdquo; burst from a thousand throats, and as
      many hands pointed to a particular spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adjoining house to Wilton&rsquo;s&mdash;now a burning mass&mdash;had a tall,
      irregular, but pointed roof, as though two rooms had been built above the
      old roof of much less dimensions than those beneath, at the smallest
      possible cost, and with an utter disregard of architectural rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the jagged side of this slanting erection a human figure was observed
      climbing slowly, his arm encircling a form all in white. His position was
      terrifyingly dangerous&mdash;the least slip, and he, together with his
      burden, would be precipitated into the burning ruins, still roaring,
      spluttering, and flaming below him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay almost flat upon his face on the rough tiles, his right hand
      grasping the carved edge of the angle of the roof. Gradually he worked his
      hand upwards, and by a tremendous exertion of strength, he drew himself
      and his companion up a foot at each movement. It was desperate labour&mdash;a
      fearful struggle with death. It seemed to those who gazed upon him a mere
      impossibility that he could save himself and the girl whom he still
      clutched round the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      On he went slowly, the bright flames lighting him in his task, but
      reducing his strength by the intense heat they threw out. He succeeded in
      getting one leg across the angle of the roof, but in doing so he slipped
      back at least two feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shriek of horror burst from the crowd, and rose up in the air like a
      death-wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth did not yet despair, but with desperate exertion he arrested his
      descent with his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused but a moment, and renewed his efforts to ascend, using his knees
      now to enable him to maintain his position on the roof, while he elevated
      his body so as to extend his reach until he obtained a hold higher than
      before, that he might thus ultimately gain a place of comparative safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Hal Vivian who was with Flora Wilton in this frightful situation.
      He had crawled in search of her into an adjoining apartment to that which
      he had entered from the street. She had hurried thither to save something
      to which she knew her father attached great importance, but, overpowered
      by the smoke, she had, after securing it, fallen senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal fortunately found her as soon as he got into the room, and the
      reflection from the fire below enabled him just to see the window. He tore
      it open, and saw that the parapet adjoined the roof of the next house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang on to it, and commenced the perilous task of endeavouring to
      escape a horrible death, and of saving, with his own, a life he esteemed
      far more valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falling roof of the house he had just quitted, when it sank with its
      dreadful crash, was within an ace of taking him with it. It was a fearful
      moment, but he surmounted it, and attempted to proceed at the instant the
      crowd caught sight of him. He heard not their cry, saw nothing, thought
      not of aught but the endeavour to reach a place of safety with her. He
      strained every nerve and sinew to accomplish his object, but human
      endurance, though backed by the urgings and influence of a strong will,
      has its limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now reached that point when, with sickening dismay, he found his
      strength failing him, and although his firmness and determination were
      unshaken, his power to go on was departing. To slacken his tenacious hold
      was to be hurled into the yawning gulph of fire behind him. He knew this
      well; that knowledge had as yet sustained him, and he clung to the roof
      still with desperation, resolved, notwithstanding the quivering of his
      fingers, the agonising aching of the arm which supported Flora, and the
      trembling of his knees, to continue to the last his exertions to save the
      maiden, or to pass out of life with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly rising up, as before, he made a clutch at the top of the roof, and
      caught it, but he found that, beyond drawing himself and the form of the
      senseless girl a little higher, he could do no more. It required an effort
      of unusual strength to reach the summit, where he believed he could remain
      safe until rescued, and that effort exhausted nature was incapable of
      making. Nay, he felt that he could but a few minutes longer cling there,
      and if some Heaven-sent aid did not reach him, his almost superhuman
      exertions would have been made in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained motionless, trying to recover his spent breath, and, while in
      this position, the hoarse cries of the people thronging in the streets
      reached his ears, and seemed to rouse him from his slowly approaching
      listless inanition. He breathed a prayer; a thought what Flora yet might
      be to him, and what that great world, of which he had yet seen so little,
      might have in store for him, flashed through his brain. The effect upon
      him was like the sound of a trumpet to the soldier at the moment of some
      fearful charge, in which death is the alternative of glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself upwards, struggling with the obstacles which seemed to try
      and force him backwards, and, almost with a scream upon his lips, he found
      himself oscillating upon the spot he had with such trying exertion sought
      to reach, exhausted, and unable to make another effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow fell upon him; he turned his feeble eyes upon the occasion of it,
      and saw one of the fire brigade, who, having laid a short ladder against
      the side of the roof, had mounted it and reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind this man rose up the helmet of a second fireman, closely following
      his comrade in his work of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal knew at a glance that Flora and himself were saved. He no longer
      strove to continue the battle with fate, and did not attempt to resist the
      embrace of insensibility as he felt the grip of the fireman upon his
      collar, and heard undistinguishable words fall from him greeting him.

      no! you have dismissed me, and I go <br /><span class="indent15">From your

      answered. <br /><span class="indent30">&mdash;John Keats. <br /><br /></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Grahame, though
      greatly agitated at the sudden appearance and abrupt disappearance of
      Nathan Gomer, at a moment of such dread importance, did not make any
      comment upon it to Mr. Chewkle. He felt unequal to such a task, and
      perhaps, too, he thought that it would be better not to suppose that the
      strange little moneyed man had either observed or suspected any foul play
      in the act he must have seen in commission. So he folded his arms, and
      remained silent, assuming the aspect of profound meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle, finding the coast clear of the small enemy, would have given
      free vent to the feelings which were turbulent and in turmoil within him,
      but Mr. Grahame repressed the very first outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray be silent on the matter,&rdquo; he observed, hastily, as if aroused
      suddenly from a fit of abstraction, &ldquo;our speculations upon the situation
      are worth nothing, and may lead us astray if suffered to have the rein.
      Keep what you know safely locked within your own breast. Trust the key in
      my keeping alone. Your reward shall not certainly be less than your
      expectations. Mr. Gomer doubtless saw me affixing a signature to a deed,
      and would presume it to be my own; he could not imagine the truth; and
      therefore, though startled at the moment, I do not, upon reflection, see
      any occasion for alarm. Let me see you again in a few days, my good
      friend, and in the meantime endeavour to suggest a mode of bringing that
      wretchedly obstinate old man, Wilton, to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame rang a hand-bell sharply, and Whelks instantly was in the
      room. Mr. Chewkle &ldquo;had a thing to say,&rdquo; which had strong reference to an
      immediate pecuniary supply; but Mr. Grahame did not afford him the
      opportunity, for he addressed Whelks as he entered, and bade him escort
      Mr. Chewkle to the door. He tendered a finger to the commission agent as a
      parting salute, honoured him with a stiff bow, and retired promptly to the
      further end of the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way if you please!&rdquo; exclaimed Whelks to Chewkle, as with head erect
      and shoulders back, he, with the stateliness of a Tartar soldier in an
      Astley&rsquo;s drama, marched out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle glanced at Mr. Grahame and at Whelks; he had a pressing
      occasion for a few pounds; but though he had quite made up his mind to ask
      for and have a sum, and indeed in a private self-communion on his way
      thither that morning, he had composed the conversation which was to take
      place between himself and Mr. Grahame, and which was to terminate in a
      princely act of munificence towards him on the part of the latter
      personage, he found himself sneaking out, treading tip-toe on the shadow
      of Whelks, without having uttered a word or having obtained a penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princely act of munificence did not come off upon this occasion, but
      he promised himself that before long it should; and, ere he was out of the
      house, he had flung his friendship for Grahame to the winds, and had
      carved for himself an antagonistic attitude, in which he played the part
      of one who, having in his possession a dreadful secret, by which the
      safety of another is compromised, makes money by it frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed upon him, Mr. Grahame turned a fitful gaze in that
      direction, and quickly, but silently, turned the key in the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he paced up and down the library, almost convulsed by a fierce,
      mental struggle. He pressed his burning palm upon his aching forehead, and
      muttered rapidly and wildly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be done now; there is no escape&mdash;no escape&mdash;none&mdash;retreat
      is utterly impossible, and the advance must be swift, or, in spite of
      crime, utter crushing ruin must be the result. No; there is no stopping
      now. That forgery is useless, worthless, while he lives to prove it what
      it is. But how dispose of him without having any apparent connection with
      his death? Let me see! I must have no accomplice. I already have one too
      many; he will be a thorn in my side, I can see that; but there is time
      enough to think of the plan by which I shall get rid of him. But this
      Wilton; he must die, and that immediately. Yes, he must die! he must die!
      or I perish! but how to kill him&mdash;how? how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself in his chair, and racked his brain for a device by which
      to accomplish his devilish purpose without compromising himself. But as he
      did so, the magnitude of the crime he proposed to effect was not lost upon
      him. He felt that his face was livid, his hands cold and clammy, while
      drops of icy sweat trickled from his temples on to his cheek bones. His
      teeth, too, chattered, and his limbs trembled, as though he had been
      suddenly nipped by a frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours elapsed before his torturing reverie terminated&mdash;even then
      he had only an indistinct notion of the course which he calculated upon,
      as the best to be adopted. The vulgar modes of knife or poison, he foresaw
      could not be employed by him, because he would have to be connected,
      however remotely, with the deed; and how to accomplish his design without
      the aid of one or the other, was a problem harder for him to work out than
      the most difficult in the &ldquo;first four books&rdquo; to an indifferent
      mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly hit upon a scheme, but he was not sure that it would
      accomplish the object in view. There was not, however, time to project a
      plan, requiring consummate skill in its details, and rare ability to
      execute. Need was driving, and the ground was such as the devil must cover
      without the option of a choice; and he made up his mind to act at once,
      for he required immediately the funds which the successful execution of
      his infamous purpose would place at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to sustain him in the resolution he had formed, he was aroused by
      the arrival of Whelks at the library door, who, when it was opened,
      informed him that his son had just returned home, accompanied by the Duke
      of St. Allborne, and the Honorable Lester Vane, and that they awaited him
      in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismissing Whelks with a message to the effect that he would immediately
      join them, he hastened to his dressing-room, to obliterate all traces of
      the mental struggle he had for so many hours endured, and, making a slight
      alteration in his attire, he descended, <br /><br /><span class="indent25">With
      solemn step and slow, </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      to welcome his son&rsquo;s guests upon their arrival from college.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found, on entering the gorgeously furnished apartment, his wife and
      daughters entertaining the new arrivals after the manner of the House&mdash;always
      excepting Evangeline, who sat back in a window recess, as if she had no
      business there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words of stately congratulation and welcome from Mr. Grahame, and
      the whole party returned to the position which it occupied when he
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keen eye of Mr. Grahame ran over the forms of the two young men who
      were thus introduced into his family for the first time, and naturally the
      young Duke was the first to attract his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall&mdash;over six feet, and stout with his height. He was fair,
      with round blue eyes, a small mouth, and no whiskers upon his cheeks or
      moustache upon his upper lip, or the sign of a hair in the vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands and feet were small, but there was a bulky, plethoric character
      about his frame, and his legs had an ungraceful leaning to knock-kneeism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice was rich and not unmusical; but, like many members
      of the aristocracy, his tongue refused to have anything to do with the
      letter <i>r</i>, and, as a not unusual consequence, he used words
      containing that letter more frequently than did persons who could sound it
      like the roll of a drumstick upon a kettle-drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed elegantly. The jewellery he wore, though spare in quantity,
      was superb in material, and super-eminently costly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Lester Vane was of an entirely different stamp; and could,
      perhaps, have better sustained the character of a duke than his friend.
      Standing about five feet ten, he was remarkably well-formed and erect, and
      seemed to be at least six feet high. He was dark; and, though not a
      military man, wore a handsomely-shaped and trimmed moustache: his features
      were regular and well-shaped: his eyes were a very dark blue, and shaded
      by long black eyelashes: his hair and whiskers being of the same hue as
      the latter. His hands were white and small, and his feet were equally neat
      in their proportions. He was dressed with consummate taste and care, and
      of all men was calculated to attract the notice of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malcolm Grahame, short in stature, was a rather ugly likeness of his
      sister Margaret, possessing all her pride, but not enough of her studied
      coldness to prevent it becoming vulgar arrogance. He was rather
      overdressed, too; and, altogether, presented a remarkable contrast to his
      college companions. It was soon perceptible that he toadied them, and that
      they both held him at no very flattering height in their estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, then, did they accompany him home? An answer to that question might
      have been found in the glances bestowed by both the young men on the
      beautiful Helen Grahame, who, conscious of her own charms, received the
      homage of their eyes as simply her due. They were both, very shortly after
      their introduction, aware that she interpreted their looks of admiration,
      rather steadfastly bestowed&mdash;that they did not surprise nor did they
      abash her&mdash;nay, when, to show her power, she flashed those brilliant
      orbs upon them by turns, with a clear, steadfast gaze, they were fain to
      let their eyelids fall, to screen their unsteady eyes from the direct,
      unfaltering look she bent upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both regarded her in the light of a prize worth having, though each looked
      on the achievement from a different point of view. One seriously hoped to
      win it without the formulary of the wedding ring&mdash;the other with that
      aid, but with the addition also of a golden store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen Grahame was unquestionably beautiful. The heightened colour of her
      cheek, the sparkling dancing of her brilliant eye, as she observed the
      impression her personal attractions had made upon the two young highborn
      men, greatly enhanced that beauty, which excited admiration even when in
      repose. It kept them at her side, and engrossed the largest share of their
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a woman&rsquo;s quickness of perception, Helen saw that she should soon
      have both these men suitors for her favour, sighing at her feet for her
      love. The gracefully fashioned form of Lester Vane pleased her eye and
      taste&mdash;the ducal coronet of his bulky friend roused her ambition and
      dazzled her; and she foresaw that she should be perplexed, when, as she
      instinctively knew would be the case, both wooed her, which to prefer. It
      was something to have a handsome &ldquo;Honorable&rdquo; for a husband&mdash;but to be
      a duchess!&mdash;ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why at the moment did she sigh so sharply?&mdash;why did a spasm run
      through her frame, and make her clutch convulsively at a chair for
      support? Was it that this momentary pang reminded her that in neither
      decision would her heart be enlisted, or that there was another and more
      grave consideration which rendered such a speculation a forbidden subject?
    </p>
    <p>
      After the common-places which usually attend an introduction, Mr. Grahame
      suggested that the guests should be shown to their respective rooms, where
      they might remove the traces of their journey, and prepare their toilet
      for dinner, to be served at half-past eight&mdash;a suggestion which was
      somewhat readily accepted, and appeared to be grateful to all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke and the Honorable Lester Vane had heard Malcolm Grahame boast of
      his beautiful sister Helen and his proud sister Meg. They had availed
      themselves of his apparently unlimited command of money, and they
      considered that his family were enormously wealthy, but vulgar and
      common-place. When Malcolm invited them home to spend a week with him, at
      his &ldquo;place&rdquo; in London, they both, having &ldquo;places&rdquo; of their own in the
      great city, looked upon the invitation as a good joke, and accepted it in
      the same spirit. They each resolved to add to the favours they had
      bestowed upon him, by permitting him always to pay, by borrowing his money
      in return for their company, and by running off with the pretty sister, of
      whom he spoke so enthusiastically. They had even entered into a bet with
      each other as to which would prove successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, however, not a little surprised to find the Grahames living in
      a style of elegant luxury, and the members of it displaying a pride of
      bearing not even surpassed by the ineffably proud Somerset himself, whose
      wife&mdash;a Percy&mdash;never attempted the liberty of kissing him. They
      were equally posed to find the pretty sister a brilliant beauty, who could
      only be approached with deference and humility; who was not to be gained
      with a glance of passion, or won by the pretended asseverations of a love
      having no existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester Vane saw his course at once. His income was narrow, and during his
      father&rsquo;s life would not be increased by inheritances or bequests from any
      branch of his family, near or remote. To gain a beautiful wife, with an
      enormous dowry, was precisely the means by which he purposed elevating
      himself to wealth, and within a few minutes after his introduction to
      Helen, he abandoned his criminal project, and took up the matrimonial one.
      He formed the determination, too, of thwarting, promptly and effectually,
      the Duke&rsquo;s designs, without appearing to do so, until he was sure of the
      lady, because he knew not when and how he might require his interest and
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Duke was quite thrown out, too, by what was presented to his
      astonished eyes. Malcolm Grahame, after all, was not the <i>parvenu</i> he
      had fancied him to be, and his sister, instead of being merely a pretty,
      silly girl, was one to grace a throne. His was not a nature easily to
      abandon a resolution once formed, and he thought of Helen as a mistress
      with a gratified emotion not to be described. A passion for her was at
      once raised in his heart. He, too, remembering his bet with Lester Vane,
      made his resolutions in respect to the intentions of his friend, but as
      his own in that particular remained unchanged, he decided upon preserving
      silence respecting it for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the young men were therefore glad to escape to their rooms, to
      recover their surprise on finding themselves in an atmosphere they had not
      expected, and in contact with persons differing materially from the
      conceptions they had formed of them. They were anxious to reflect upon
      their line of conduct during their stay, and having well considered the
      path to choose, to follow it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls and their mother were glad of an opportunity of comparing
      notes and devising plans, to be carried out so long as their guests
      remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame seemed to be in a dream, glad to be away from everybody, yet
      hating to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant dinner was served at the appointed hour. As there was no point
      of resemblance in the characters of those present, save in those of
      Margaret Grahame and her mother, the conversation was certainly not
      monotonous. It afforded, however, an opportunity for those interested in
      such a task to observe and mentally comment upon their companions, and to
      draw conclusions to be treasured up for future use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of St. Allborne was placed on the right hand of Mr. Grahame, the
      Honorable Lester Vane on the right of Mrs. Grahame, the Duke enjoyed the
      pleasure of having the fair Helen as his right hand neighbour, and Lester
      Vane was honoured with the company of Margaret, for which he was not
      disposed to be especially grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evangeline faced her brother Malcolm, and thus arranged they proceeded to
      discuss the various courses, to partake of the choicest wines, to
      converse, and to gaze upon each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last item was by no means the least important. The Duke did his best
      to engross the conversation of Helen, and to keep his round light blue
      eyes settled upon her, which she affected only to observe now and then by
      accident. Then a scarcely perceptible smile turned the corners of her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep blue eyes of Lester Vane rarely left her face, even when he was
      addressed by others. As often as she turned hers in his direction, which,
      with a motive, she did occasionally, she perceived his earnest, dreamy
      gaze fixed upon her. Twice or thrice it made her shudder, she knew not
      why. It was fixed, expressive, teeming with passion, but, if it possessed
      fascination, it was that of the serpent. Insensibly, every now and then
      her eyes wandered towards his, and settled for a moment upon them, each
      was conscious of the effect they were creating, and when Helen averted
      hers, a strange dread thrilled through her frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although the beautiful face of this girl absorbed so much of Vane&rsquo;s
      gaze, he was not ignorant of the fact that there was another face
      possessing great claims to loveliness at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the timid reserve of Evangeline had caused him to pass her over
      unnoticed, but now that she sat almost opposite to him, he could not fail
      to notice her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was attired in a dinner dress of pale blue and silver, and, being very
      fair, looked charming. Her gentleness and quietness prevented her
      attracting much attention. To the Duke she was mixed up with the lights,
      the plate, and Malcolm Grahame, but the eye of Vane marked her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must fall in with her when she is alone,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;early in the
      morning or in byeways. She can be made, I am sure, to believe and to keep
      a secret, at any self-sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more his eye fell upon Helen, who was turning her dark, bright eyes
      upon the Duke, and electrifying him with her beauty, while she confused
      him by the smartness of her sallies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have her,&rdquo; mused Lester Vane. &ldquo;It may be a task surrounded with
      almost insuperable difficulties, but I will have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Claverhouse Grahame divided her attentions between her plate and
      the young Duke. She had estimated Lester Vane at pretty much his value,
      and therefore did not trouble her head any more about him. She fastened
      her gray eyes upon the Duke as often as her dinner would admit, and she
      came to the same conclusion respecting him that Lester Vane had with her
      sister Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be mine. He is fat and awkward,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;but he is a duke,
      and I am born to bear the rank of a duchess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the period appointed by etiquette for the ladies to retire arriving,
      the young ladies, led by Mrs. Grahame, quitted the apartment, to leave the
      gentlemen to their wine. They were now on much more familiar terms with
      each other, and, as the ladies retired, the Duke rising with the
      gentlemen, said to Helen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weally, Miss Gwahame, I gwow evwy day moah and moah convinced that the
      wegulation which dwove the ladies fwom our society, though only faw a
      time, was absolutely bawbawous; and the pwesent fashion which pwescwibes a
      limit to the sepawation, an intwo-duction of the most admiwable kind.
      Believe me, I shall, with all wespect to my hospitable host, count the
      minutes until we join you in the dwawing woom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I!&rdquo; exclaimed Lester Vane, in a tone of voice which compelled Helen
      to turn towards him; their eyes met&mdash;again she felt a strange,
      thrilling dread pass over her frame; she turned her eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grateful!&rdquo; she responded with a bow, and hastily quitted the room
      with her mother and sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not enter the drawing-room, but ran into her own dressing-room,
      and, throwing herself in a chair, buried her face in a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave way to a passionate burst of tears; presently she drew from her
      bosom a small note, broke the seal, and perused its contents many times,
      and then she crushed it in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How inopportune!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a vexed tone; &ldquo;any night but this;
      still the terms are so peremptory; what is to be done?&rdquo; She looked at her
      watch. &ldquo;It is the hour,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what if I let it pass by, and go not?
      we part then to meet no more&mdash;no, no, that must not be&mdash;oh,
      fickle heart, to what fate will you drive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment her maid entered the room, and she hastily secreted the
      note. She mused for a second, and then she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chayter, give me a shawl; I will walk in the garden; my head aches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very dark, miss,&rdquo; returned the girl, &ldquo;and the air is getting cold.
      It will be dangerous to your health to walk there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a shawl, Chayter,&rdquo; cried Helen, impatiently. &ldquo;It is my pleasure
      to walk there&mdash;my brain burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl knew it was useless to remonstrate further, and handed her a
      thick shawl, which she threw hastily over her head, and left the room. In
      a moment she returned, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chayter, that dress I bade you alter this morning, you may keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh thank you, miss,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, joyfully, for it was a rich one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Chayter, remain here until you see me. Remember that if I am sent
      for, to say that I am lying upon my couch for a few minutes, and do not
      wish to be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not mention a word to any one that I have gone to the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to a soul, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good girl; I will reward you on my return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she concluded, she hastened down the private staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a sweetheart, I&rsquo;ll swear!&rdquo; murmured Chayter reflectively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      find that out, see if I don&rsquo;t that will be many a dress in my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen hurried on tiptoe until she reached one of the parlours which had a
      window opening on to the lawn. She passed out thence, closing the window
      silently after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept upon the lawn, in the shadow of the house, for a short distance,
      and then pursuing a winding path, did not pause until she reached a small
      thicket of trees planted on the banks of a tongue of land curving the
      ornamental waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she stood still for a moment, and then she coughed thrice. A voice
      whispered, &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; and she clapped her hand. The next instant there
      issued from the thicket a young man, who immediately placed himself at her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared you would not come, dearest!&rdquo; he said, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh!&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;it was indeed a task difficult to execute, but
      you so earnestly wished me to meet you that I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is shameful of me to doubt you, Helen, after the proofs of affection
      which you have bestowed upon me, yet I know the full value of my prize,
      and I so fear to lose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you still love me, Hugh?&rdquo; she asked, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love you!&mdash;oh, Helen! why do you ask that terrible question? Have I
      changed in look, in word, in thought, in act?&rdquo; he exclaimed, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;oh, no! yet do you not think a time may come when your
      love for me will be diverted to another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not, Hugh, imagine a time when one fairer, less exacting, more
      gentle, than myself, may win from me that love you say I now alone
      possess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, this language affrights me&mdash;I do not understand it!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, in a tone of surprise; and then added, passionately, &ldquo;surely it
      is not for you to hazard such a terrible supposition! I love you, Helen&mdash;I
      have sworn it! I shall never change, never swerve from that adoration,
      that idolatry, with which I worship you. Oh! we are about to part for a
      time, Helen, and is this a moment to raise such doubts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his clenched hand upon his heart, and said, with deep emotion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I repeat, we are about to part: you cannot have met me to tell me
      that the love you have declared for me, the love which you have proved,
      and which I have, oh! so fondly, so dearly cherished, has faded suddenly
      away at a moment, and you wish that the separation commencing now should
      last for ever? You dare not do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no, Hugh, no!&rdquo; she cried earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; he ejaculated, in low but deep tones, as though his very
      existence depended upon her answer, &ldquo;you have, as I believe, proved to me
      that you loved me; you love me still, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, yes, Hugh,&rdquo; she returned, with fervour, &ldquo;I do, indeed, Hugh,
      love you with my whole soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank upon his breast, and he pressed his lips to hers, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant there was the sound of a footstep upon the gravel path.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang from his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, be silent!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes in the direction of the advancing footsteps, and saw,
      approaching the spot where she stood with her companion, the Honorable
      Lester Vane.

    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> sudden
      involuntary effort of the memory had nearly cost Flora Wilton her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that dreadful moment, when the house in which she had for years resided
      was a prey to the raging flames, when her own escape&mdash;owing to the
      fearful rapidity with which the fire gained ascendancy&mdash;was a
      question of doubt, she had remembered a packet of papers, which her father
      had given into her charge, with injunctions to preserve it, even at the
      hazard of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been placed by herself in a spot, which though secret, was yet of
      easy access. To obtain it would be but the act of a minute; the
      fire-escape conductor had yet to return to convey her from the burning
      house, to the street below; and she made the attempt simultaneously with
      the conception of the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room she entered was densely filled with smoke. She obtained the
      object of her search. She remembered no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When again consciousness returned to her, she was in the arms of Hal, high
      in the air, upon a dreadful slope, the ruddy glare of the roaring flames
      making visible to her the frightful danger of her position. She relapsed
      into insensibility, and when once more she opened her eyes, she found
      herself in bed, the motherly face of an elderly woman bending over her,
      and her wrist in the hand of a white-haired medical attendant, who had
      himself applied the restoratives which had brought her back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand questions thronged to her lips, first wonder, then incoherence,
      then, with an awakening sense of what had happened, her desolate destitute
      condition burst with full force upon her, and she fell into a passionate
      fit of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft, kindly voice of the woman at her side was addressed to her in
      soothing tones, while the strictest injunctions fell from the lips of the
      doctor, forbidding speech on either side. He recommended Flora to commend
      herself to God, and then endeavour to sleep, under the conviction that the
      fearful event in which she had borne so prominent a part had not involved
      any loss of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Flora! she had no words at command, no language in which to express
      the emotions the horrors of the night had occasioned, and she obeyed the
      doctor&rsquo;s behest of silence simply because her tongue refused its office.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened to the exhortations addressed to her, and made a feeble
      motion to the effect that she would endeavour to comply with the wishes
      that had been expressed: and so she was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast her weeping eyes around; but, in the well-furnished room,
      recognised no object that could enlighten her upon that point. By the aid
      of the light of the candle, which had been left burning upon a table, she
      could distinguish everything in the room plainly enough, but there was
      nothing to tell her whose house she was within.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had a surmise. Women, quick at assumption, are rarely far wrong in
      their suppositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, when she opened her eyes to find herself at a dizzy height above
      the uproar of the excited multitude assembled to witness the destruction
      of the dwelling by the remorseless fire, saw, too, that she was in the
      firm grasp of Harry Vivian. She remembered that now; and she was led to
      believe, therefore, that she had been conveyed by him to the house of his
      uncle, and that the kind and tender matron who had spoken to her such
      words of tenderness was his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lip quivered as the thought passed through her mind, and when&mdash;following
      the counsel of the doctor, no less than the dictates of her own pure mind&mdash;she
      offered up a prayer of thankfulness to the Throne of Grace for her escape,
      she invoked a blessing upon the head of him who had perilled so much to
      accomplish the work of her deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that it is seldom a woman disposes of her own heart&mdash;circumstances
      decide for her. One thing is certain&mdash;that she does not long remain
      in ignorance when her heart has been made captive. A man may for some time
      believe and assure himself that he only admires and esteems some very
      pretty girl: an accident will, however, disclose to him that he loves her.
      This is not the case with woman: a man upon whom she casts at first an
      indifferent eye may possess attractions which, gradually gaining her good
      will, ultimately win her affections; but her heart will no sooner be his
      than she becomes cognizant of the fact, and she takes her position
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had been present many times when Hal Vivian had visited her father
      upon business. She had been irresistibly struck by his handsome face and
      well-formed figure, his pleasant expression of countenance, and his mild,
      courteous manner; but, if she had then thought of him at all, it was to
      consider him as an amiable young man&mdash;bearing the palm, perhaps, from
      every other she had as yet seen&mdash;nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as she sought to close her eyes in sleep, she saw vividly his face,
      the bright red glow of the fire glaring upon it; she saw his glittering
      eye, his contracted brow, his inflated nostril, and compressed lip, the
      collective symbols of brave energy; she saw, too, that the contour was
      handsome and noble&mdash;with an almost painful distinctness she perceived
      that the daring effort of courage, which then so brilliantly animated his
      fine face, was solely made to save her from a dreadful death.
    </p>
    <p>
      While giving him full credit for the very noblest impulse, she had not
      been true to her woman&rsquo;s nature if she had not instinctively felt that his
      arduous exertions received an impetus from some favourable impression she
      had created upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indefinite, unacknowledged as this conception, in her agitated state,
      really was, it was not without its influence in composing her to slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dead mother&rsquo;s pale face seemed to look down upon her from its place in
      heaven, gently and placidly. Her father&rsquo;s countenance, quivering with an
      agonised anxiety of expression, disturbed and sorrowful, oppressed her,
      but the features of Hal floated before her vision, appearing to grow
      brighter and brighter in her eyes, and to suggest a hopeful and happy
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was broad daylight when she awoke. She turned her pained eyes around
      her, and beheld at her side again that same kind, motherly face which had
      been the first she looked upon the night before, when recovering from
      insensibility. She was greeted with kind words as on the previous
      occasion, and was permitted this time not only to recur mentally to the
      sad event of the night before, but to obtain some control over her natural
      emotions before a question was put to her, which called upon her to utter
      a word. During this interval, she learned that all her surmises had been
      founded on a true basis; that she was indebted to Hal Vivian for an almost
      miraculous escape from a dreadful death, and that she had been received
      and sheltered beneath the roof of Mr. Harper, where she was assured that
      she was welcome to remain until some arrangements for her comfort and
      convenience could be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, Flora was given to understand that the good Samaritan before her
      was Mrs. Harper, who, though she had servants in the house, believed that
      her own ministrations to the suffering girl would be attended with more
      beneficial results than if she had delegated the task to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harper was a truly generous, kind-hearted woman, and her efforts to
      serve others had, at least, the gratifying effect of rewarding herself,
      for hitherto she had been so fortunate as not to misplace them, or throw
      them away on unworthy objects. Her doves of pity and goodwill had always
      brought her back an olive branch, and if they had not, it is doubtful
      whether she would have ceased to render those services which came so
      opportunely, and were so grateful to whoever needed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Flora could command herself to speak, she, in warm and eloquent
      terms, expressed her deep and earnest gratitude for that self-sacrificing
      bravery which the nephew of Mrs. Harper had exhibited in the behalf of
      herself, and to the goodness and charity of the old lady, who, in her
      distress, had granted her so valuable an asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, my child,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Harper. &ldquo;For my part, I wish
      my hospitality had been afforded to you under happier circumstances. And
      as for Hal, Heaven bless us! I thought I should have died when I saw him
      crawling with you up the roof of that horrible old house over the way. I&rsquo;m
      sure I never expected to see you come down alive, either of you, and, in
      truth, I don&rsquo;t believe you would if it hadn&rsquo;t been for those bold firemen,
      who, mercy on us! were up in the flames, moving about like a parcel of
      demons in the fiery regions in the play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora clasped her hands, and said sorrowfully&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This perilling of life for me, and I can in no way repay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, my dear,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Harper, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think about that&mdash;these
      men are paid for their work; it is their duty, and they are used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Vivian?&rdquo; suggested Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I said, my dear,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Harper, garrulously. &ldquo;Hal is
      neither paid for nor used to such work, but when I said so, he closed my
      mouth with a kiss, and vowed that it was his duty that he had performed,
      and if it was to do again he would not hesitate one minute to go through
      all he did last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so noble!&rdquo; said Flora, with the faintest of sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Harper. &ldquo;He looks rather jaded this
      morning, and so odd with his whiskers and eyebrows singed with the fierce
      fire. Ah! it was a dreadful sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Flora, with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he was so eager to know how you were,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Harper,
      &ldquo;Dear me, what a many questions he asked me about you. Ah! well, I told
      him you should yourself reply to him bye and bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was conscious of a rosy hue stealing into her cheek. She thought of
      his deep, earnest eyes, and how steadfastly they would after the late
      event settle upon hers, and how she would never be able to meet his,
      though she had at other times and recently done so without even a passing
      thought upon the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was this? She sighed&mdash;perhaps she guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some two or three days before she was enabled to grant an interview
      to Hal, anxious as she was for the meeting. All her clothes had been
      consumed by the fire, and Mrs. Harper&rsquo;s dresses were &ldquo;a world too wide&rdquo;
       for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was not affected on the point of dress. She had no unnecessary or
      false pride in that respect, but she had the natural regard to external
      appearance, which every woman, young or old, unless utterly lost,
      possesses; and, though she was not truly cognisant of the influence a
      tasteful arrangement of well-fashioned garments would have in heightening
      charms already of a very superior order, she had no desire to present
      herself to Harry Vivian disguised in a dress sufficiently capacious for
      Mrs. Harper, but in no degree contract-able to her dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With most generous spirit and charming willingness, the old lady put the
      powers of her draper and her dressmaker into active requisition, and Flora
      was able to quit her room in the time mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rapidly recovered her health and a certain serenity of mind. The loss
      of all her father&rsquo;s little property, buried among the charred ruins
      opposite, was an evil to be regretted, but it was a fact which no grief
      could disturb or obviate. A remedy was to be sought&mdash;something was to
      be done for herself, probably for her father too, who, an inmate of a
      prison, was scarcely likely to be able to help himself; and from the
      moment she came to recognise and comprehend her position, her mind busied
      itself in forming plans for the future, by which she should at least be
      able to support him who had no one now in the wide, wide world to look up
      to but herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was hopeful and sanguine, but she knew very little of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mr. Harper knew a very great deal about it, plain and matter-of-fact
      as he appeared. He had for some time past determined to have a country
      house at Islington&mdash;in fact, had decided upon it, and was slowly
      having it furnished. He pushed on the work now; for, after a very grave
      consultation with Mrs. Harper, his wife, he decided that the poor girl,
      bereaved of home by fire, and of a father by the law, could not turn out
      into the streets. So, looking upon her as a trust confided to his care by
      the Almighty, he resolved to take charge of her, house, feed, and clothe
      her, until something was done in her behalf by such persons as had a
      better title to perform the good work than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at the end of a week, he calculated upon entering his new house at
      Highbury, which he should leave in the morning and return to at night,
      accompanied by his nephew, and he resolved that Flora Wilton should become
      an inmate as well as those who constituted his family. He absolutely
      chuckled to think what a delightful companion she would make his wife,
      who, having lived so long in the old house in Clerkenwell, would find the
      solitude of her new home, without such society as that now ready for her,
      absolutely insupportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harper confided to Hal the task of imparting to Flora his intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She owes you something for the service you afforded her in escaping,&rdquo;
       said the old goldsmith, &ldquo;and so if she raises any foolish objection, the
      prompting of a reluctance to become burdensome, or any such stuff as that&mdash;for
      she is just the sort of girl to show a great deal of pride, you know&mdash;you
      will be able to combat her arguments and reason her out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal&rsquo;s face lighted up as though a sunbeam had made it radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happiness to have her dwelling at his home, her eyes to greet him
      when he returned at night, and follow him when he departed in the morning,
      her sweet-toned voice to welcome him and to speed him on his way, her
      delicious presence to smoothe down the fatigues of his daily labour, and
      to wile away imperceptibly hours which otherwise might drag their slow
      length tediously along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Vivian, overflowing with Mr. Harper&rsquo;s instructions and his own
      emotions of delight, one morning by arrangement entered the room in which
      Flora was seated alone, and advanced towards her shyly and slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, who, as the door opened, turned her gaze upon it as though she
      <br /><br /><span class="indent15">Knew whose gentle hand was on the latch,
      <br /><span class="indent15">Ere the door had given him to her eyes,
      </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      as he made his way into the apartment, rose up. The colour fled from her
      cheek, and she was seized with such a sudden and violent palpitation of
      the heart that she was forced back into her chair again. She trembled all
      over. Then her cheek flushed, and she felt once more impelled to rise and
      hurry towards him to grasp his hand, and pour forth a torrent of eloquent
      gratefulness. The emotion which she experienced was new and strange to
      her; her every nerve thrilled rather with a sense of pleasure rather than
      with any other feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was confused, dizzy. But withal, an overpowering gladness reigned
      within her soul that he and she were once more face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, they were palm to palm, too. At first without a word. What could they
      say? their hearts were too full for utterance; both remembered how
      together they had trembled on the verge of eternity, and there was a deep
      solemnity in the thought, which, for the moment, forbade speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was the first&mdash;wonderful gift pertaining to woman&mdash;to
      recover her self-possession. In words, low toned, but earnest and
      heartfelt, she expressed her sense of the obligation she owed him, and
      though he, recovering, too, his speech, would have stayed her, she was not
      to be so checked, but gave utterance to all her full heart dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own life I am your debtor. I am sensible what I owe to you on that
      account,&rdquo; she observed, with much feeling, &ldquo;and I can never, never
      discharge the obligation; nay, perhaps I would not if I could, for indeed,
      Mr. Vivian, after the brave and noble conduct you have displayed, it
      affords me a gratification I have no words to describe, to know that I
      shall henceforward be attached to you by ties of gratitude which no
      adverse circumstances can ever sunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did she suddenly turn so crimson, and look affrighted at the words
      which she herself had uttered? Was it that Hal&rsquo;s eye danced with joy, or
      that he raised her hand to his lips, and pressed it with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it matters not; her eye fell upon the ground, and her hand remained
      within his; she did not offer to withdraw it, though he had kissed it
      softly and tenderly it is true, but not without a little <i>empressement</i>&mdash;if
      ever so little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen her frightened look, but her words had made his heart
      leap, and but that he had the proposition of his uncle to make, it is not
      impossible that he would have responded to them by confessing that her
      attachment, however ardent, was fully reciprocated by him. As it was, he
      restrained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Wilton,&rdquo; he said, in a somewhat tremulous tone, &ldquo;do not
      over-rate my services; I was excited by the occurrence, and acted upon an
      impulse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noble one, Mr. Vivian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not uncommon. Thousands would have done as I have done, had they
      similar opportunities, and I should have exerted myself equally had you
      been an entire stranger to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I believe,&rdquo; said Flora, innocently and praise-fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; continued Hal, correcting himself, for he did not quite
      like her to entertain that belief, &ldquo;my impression is that I should. I must
      acknowledge, Miss Wilton, that knowing you, as I have had the honour of
      doing for some time, I had an additional incentive to endeavour to snatch
      you from an awful death. I very much congratulate myself that I succeeded,
      and I pray you to believe that you cannot be more overjoyed at my good
      fortune than myself. Thank God, you are safe, and I hope almost recovered
      from the fright. We will let the past go, and cast an eye upon the
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already done so,&rdquo; interposed Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not dispute it, my dear Miss Wilton,&rdquo; returned he, speaking quietly
      yet firmly, as though to drown all opposition; &ldquo;but my uncle has been
      beforehand with you. He is a man of the world, and knows much; he is a
      wealthy man, too, Miss Wilton, and can well afford to be kind,
      considerate, and generous. He is quite alive to the very embarrassing
      position in which the late sad disaster has placed you, and he is anxious
      that you should not experience its inconvenience during the interval which
      must elapse between any arrangements you may be able to make hereafter for
      your future course. He has laid out his plans, with which you are
      connected; he confesses that they are not without a little selfishness in
      them, but he is wishful that you should overlook that, and not offer any
      opposition to the proposal he has empowered me to make to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, then, in the most delicate words he was able to employ, laid before
      her his uncle&rsquo;s plan, and begged her to assent to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have refused, under present circumstances, would have been simply a
      preposterous absurdity; she had no such notion, but she felt this
      additional kindness most acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent, because she felt that she should sob as she spoke, if
      she attempted to give utterance to her feelings. She turned her large
      eyes, suffused in tears, upon him&mdash;he was easily able to read their
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      With instinctive delicacy, desirous of sparing her further distress from
      painful recollections, he terminated the interview here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a rejoiced spirit he interpreted her look of overflowing gratitude as
      an acceptance of his uncle&rsquo;s liberal offer, and he once more pressed her
      unreluctant hand, as, relieving her of any necessity for speaking, he
      informed her that he should convey to his kind-hearted relative her
      judicious decision upon the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he were not in love now, it is more than doubtful if ever he could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the period which had elapsed between the rescue and the present
      moment, Flora had not, for an instant, forgotten her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of dire misery which pervaded his features, when he parted
      from her in custody of Messrs. Jukes and Sudds, remained present to her as
      vividly as though it had been photographed upon her vision. It haunted
      her, and added greatly to the sad impression with which the recent
      occurrences and several afflicting events had clouded her young life in
      the years immediately past.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished so much to see her father again, to be with him, to minister to
      his wants and to his comforts, to both of which, she felt assured, he had
      no one to attend, and must, therefore, be plunged into a state of
      despairing wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accepting the offer of Mr. Harper, she saw&mdash;in no selfish or
      narrow-minded spirit, that she would, in her present dreadful strait, be
      at least provided with a home, until some means were obtained to place her
      where she would be no longer a burden to Mr. Harper, and she had not,
      therefore, hesitated thankfully to fall in with the arrangement proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she desired to be the companion and loving attendant upon her father
      in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      In prison!
    </p>
    <p>
      How that dreadful word rang in her ears!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had but a vague notion of that receptacle for vice, dishonesty, and
      misfortune. She had no clear perception of the difference between the
      debtor&rsquo;s and the criminal&rsquo;s place of incarceration. To her it was one huge
      black building, frowning and grim in its aspect without; all cells,
      chains, and torture within.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some such a place she believed her father to have been borne. She
      shrank not to share his captivity She had a sense that the air would be
      foul, stifling, pestiferous, and the cell wanting the light of day. She
      pictured four black, mildewed walls, a straw bed, always damp with slime
      and dank with humid earth, a small wretched table, a pitcher of water, and
      a lump of dark, noisome bread. She had heard of such places. There might
      be some alleviation where the crime was only inability to pay, but a
      prison was still a prison, and hopeful as she might be that his condition
      was not so bad, yet she could see it in no other light.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs. Harper she revealed her wishes, but that good lady not only had a
      difficulty in believing in its practicability, but even in its propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harper was consulted, and he hastened to set Flora right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Miss Wilton, that I have overlooked the
      situation of your father&mdash;common humanity would have forbidden that.
      I made it my duty to send to him, as early as the gates of the
      establishment where he is detained were open, on the morning after the
      fire, to let him know that the sad disaster had happened, but that his
      child was safe in my charge. I further caused him to be informed that as
      soon as you were able to leave your chamber, you would go to him, and
      explain all that I was unable to communicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! let me go to him at once,&rdquo; cried Flora eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel strong enough, certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Harper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! I am quite strong enough, quite&mdash;indeed I am. I so long to
      see him; I have so much, so very much to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so; Hal shall accompany you to protect you. You cannot go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! it would not be well to do so. Through the agency of some unknown
      friend, a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> has been obtained, and your father
      has been removed from Whitecross Street to the Queen&rsquo;s Prison&mdash;all of
      which you do not understand. However, there he is, and the place is one of
      which you can have no conception. The assemblage there is large, mixed,
      and not scrupulous in its behaviour. You would be bewildered without some
      one to make inquiries for you, and be, perhaps, rudely assailed by the
      unreflecting or the callous and the impertinent. Yes; Hal shall go with
      you, and you will, believe me, find the prison somewhat different to the
      picture you have sketched in your imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora listened in silence, and acquiesced in the arrangement, not that the
      disagreeable part of it would be the society of Hal&mdash;nay, she would
      have gone with Jukes rather than not have gone at all, malicious ogre as
      she considered him&mdash;but she would have preferred to have gone alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt an intuitive reluctance that Hal, whom she so much esteemed, and
      whom, therefore, she would have wished to have seen her relatives in their
      best light, should visit her father in a prison, and that the visit should
      be paid with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But inexorable circumstances compelling, she set out with him, her small
      hand resting upon his arm, and making him feel a far wealthier and happier
      potentate than any monarch that ever reigned upon earth.

      reached the lodge, or gate, as it is called, of the Queen&rsquo;s Prison, Hal
      and Flora gazed with surprise on the motley group waiting for the door to
      be unlocked, that they might enter to see those confined within.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sallow faced, black-haired turnkey, who seemed all eyes, was what is
      called &ldquo;on the lock,&rdquo; and he &ldquo;took stock&rdquo; of every individual about to
      pass into the prison with a sharp scrutiny, and with a rapidity which told
      that this had been for years his daily practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young and old, rich and poor, were standing there together, elbow to
      elbow. The shabby man, who acted as messenger&mdash;the aristocrat,
      moustached and habited in the latest fashion&mdash;the slatternly dressed
      woman, with a basket containing small purchases&mdash;and the fine lady,

       for a few thousands, and whose carriage waited without the gate&mdash;the
      squalid child, the pampered boy, the virtuous and the vicious&mdash;were
      huddled together, forming no indifferent sample of the congregation
      gathered within the embrace of the high brick chevaux-de-frise crested
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey, who had been reading a newspaper with one eye and surveying
      his guests with the other, having found the collection of guests large
      enough, rose slowly up and opened the door. A crowd was waiting on the
      opposite side to come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hal, with his young and beautiful but shrinking companion, passed the
      turnkey, he inquired where he should find Mr. Wilton, and had to repeat
      his question before he could obtain a reply. At last, as the way was being
      stopped up because Hal, with the blood tingling in his forehead, refused
      to budge until he obtained his answer, the man said, in a low and surly
      tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 5, in No. 10.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal passed on and entered a long quadrangle, where he saw assembled some
      three or four hundred persons of all descriptions, many of them passing
      away their hours of confinement in the game of rackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of surprise burst from both his lips and from Flora&rsquo;s. Her
      visions of a damp, horrible dungeon were dissipated in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was cloudless, and as the sun streamed down among the hordes
      congregated together, bustling here and there, standing in groups, or
      engaged actively at rackets, laughing, shouting, or speaking in high
      tones, the scene appeared more like a community enjoying a festival day
      than a body of prisoners in confinement, visited by condoling friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s surprised eyes ran eagerly over the lively masses, thronging in
      groups, or moving rapidly to and fro, and she felt a great weight removed
      from her heart, although even her small stock of worldly knowledge told
      her that the aspect of the society she beheld gathered here was a shade
      shabbier, and a dash more slovenly than that met with &ldquo;outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both she and her companion were slightly confused, but the latter, after a
      curious gaze at the motley multitude, turned his attention to the object
      with which he visited the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw upon the arched doorways leading to the prison chambers, a painted
      number upon the key-stone, and shrewdly guessed at the explanation of &ldquo;No
      5 in No. 10,&rdquo; which had at first a little mystified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could advance many paces, an experienced eye picked him out as
      an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; and a visitor. A dingy tattered man&mdash;sallow with long
      confinement, and the pressure of an enduring poverty, which had, as he who
      gave it as a toast, said, stuck by him long after his friends had deserted
      him&mdash;touched Hal on the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger here, I see,&rdquo; he observed, as the young man turned sharply
      around; &ldquo;come to see a friend, I presume. If you will honour me with the
      name of the gentleman residing here, I will conduct you straight to his
      room. If you don&rsquo;t find him there, I&rsquo;ll search for him among the players&mdash;sure
      to find him&mdash;one of the conveniences of this establishment is, that
      the friend you call to see is never far from his hutch&mdash;&lsquo;not at home&rsquo;
      is not known in our vocabulary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal saw that the information was to be purchased at an arbitrary gift. He
      felt that a guide was unnecessary, as the information he had received from
      the turnkey, though not at first clear, was plain enough now. Yet there
      was something in the careworn aspect of the man&rsquo;s features&mdash;in the
      wistful, anxious expression of his eye&mdash;telling of the strong hope he
      had now before him of obtaining a breakfast; so that Hal, who had
      breakfasted heartily, could not find it in his heart to disappoint his
      expectations; and, after a perusal of the poor fellow&rsquo;s face, and a hasty
      glance at his threadbare attire, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see a Mr. Wilton. Do you know where he is&mdash;situated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal had almost said, confined, but he arrested the word ere it left his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilton, Wilton,&rdquo; repeated the man; &ldquo;he is a new comer, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied Hal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the man, &ldquo;then he is either 2 in 8, or 7 in 4, or&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can save you the trouble of speculating by telling you&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;5 in 10,&rdquo; interrupted the man; &ldquo;that is the only other room which has
      been recently occupied. The lawyers&mdash;you a lawyer, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal laughed freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am not a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to hear it. The precious rastals! they have been driving a roaring
      trade lately. Ah, sir! what a glorious country this would have been
      without lawyers! No writs, no executions, no imprisonment for debt. By
      Jove! what a splendid state of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shut his eyes to enjoy the ecstacy he felt even in imagining such
      an Utopia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For swindlers no doubt!&rdquo; observed Hal, with a smile; &ldquo;but lawyers are
      essentially necessary to prevent honest men being devoured by rogues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, sir; that is one side of the question. If they confined
      themselves to that line, they would be a valuable body of professionals,
      but unfortunately they do not. You are too young and too inexperienced to
      know that they are much more the rogue&rsquo;s friend than the honest man&rsquo;s
      counsellor and servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t know. I hope you may never have occasion to know. I do; God
      knows I do. I have been here eighteen years, sir. Never in all that time
      beyond the door through which you entered this pandemonium. The lawyers
      brought me here, and here I am likely to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you take the Benefit&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the Act. No! I am here for contempt of court&mdash;a contempt of which
      I am intentionally as innocent as you are&mdash;a contempt about which I
      knew nothing&mdash;yet the rascally lawyers clapped me in here for it, and
      here I have been ever since, because I am not able to purge my contempt,
      as they call it. Besides, if it were not for contempt that I am here, I
      couldn&rsquo;t take the Benefit, for I am connected with a large property, and I
      don&rsquo;t intend to let the villains have that simply because I should, like a
      bird, be glad to get out of my cage. However, sir, you want to see Mr.
      Wilton, and not to listen to my doleful history. Come along, sir, this
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuffled onward as he spoke, and Hal prepared to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, he caught sight of a man within three feet of him, fastening
      a stare of passionate admiration upon Flora&rsquo;s sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze was impudent only so far as that it was fixed and steadfast He
      had caught sight of her countenance and had stopped short, as though he
      had been transfixed suddenly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about forty years of age, evidently a gentleman, probably a
      military man, for his carriage was remarkably erect, and his upper lip&mdash;though
      that nowadays is no symbol of the profession of arms&mdash;was garnished
      with a thin, black moustache, long at the ends, and having the appearance
      of being perpetually manipulated by the finger and thumb of either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      His complexion was very dark, bearing evidence of having for years been
      exposed to the tender mercies of an Indian sun. His eyes were a brilliant
      jet and unusually large; they flashed as he moved them; his hair, which
      was short, was black, as were his whiskers, which were thin and polished,
      curling at the edges with a uniformity that spoke of irons.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attire was plain and dark, but that of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was evidently one in no common position. Hal ran his eye scrutinisingly
      over him, and then turned a side glance at Flora, whose face he perceived
      to be flushed, and its expression that of one distressed at being thus
      rudely stared out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, with the instincts of his youth, he felt convulsed with a
      jealous rage, and burned to commit himself in some wrathful and violent
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Flora was nearest to the stranger, and must have touched him as she
      passed, Hal moved her by an easy act. Setting his shoulder firm, he
      increased his pace, as if to follow the messenger, and came into sharp
      collision with the gentleman, who had not yet removed his eyes from the
      face of Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the concussion was to thrust him back some two or three
      feet, while Hal passed on apparently unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another minute, and the latter felt his shoulder rudely seized. He wheeled
      round instanter. The man he had pushed out of his path was at his side,
      his features distorted with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unmannerly cub!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how dare you thrust yourself against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite able to frame the explanation if you require one, and to
      comprehend my refusal to make any apology,&rdquo; returned Hal, with calmness.
      &ldquo;Let me also counsel you not to repeat the offence of which you have been
      guilty, or the consequences, as now, may not terminate in a simple
      collision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved on, as the excited individual exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for that fair creature on your arm, I would have caned you soundly,
      you insolent puppy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal&rsquo;s lip curled contemptuously; he refrained from replying to the threat,
      and left the man to resent his conduct in any shape he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now before the open dooorway, No. 10, and followed the messenger
      up the worn stone steps that looked as though water was to them a fable
      and grease their daily food.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the aid of the iron banisters and Hal&rsquo;s arm, Flora, with beating heart,
      reached the second flight, and saw the messenger who had preceded them
      halting in the stone corridor before a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon it was painted the figure 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was 5, in 10, and within the room which that painted door
      guarded, was her father, a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no grim turnkey, no dripping walls, no dark dungeon&mdash;though
      Heaven knows the vaulted passages lighted by small, arched, iron-grated
      windows, looked dreary enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said the messenger, &ldquo;the room where Mr. Wilton is
      staying; and with better luck than I have. Ah, sir, my friends have all
      died, or wandered away long ago, and I, without them, or help of any kind,
      have been obliged to declare myself on the County. That means, sir, that I
      am supplied with a room and a scanty allowance of food by the authorities,
      but not a farthing in money, sir, not a farthing. You see before you, sir,
      a wretch who has not a farthing, nor any means of obtaining one, save
      through the charity of kind persons like yourself, who reward me with a
      trifle for conducting them to their friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and drew forth half-a-crown.
      The usual reward was about twopence. Sometimes, by the tough-skinned, a
      penny was doled out, or a profitless, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; but half-a-crown&mdash;that
      was unhoped-for munificence. With economy, how long would it supply him
      with tobacco and beer?
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s eye glistened as a ray of light fell upon the coin. It was one
      of the last new dies, and was bright as from the Mint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful piece of silver!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a grin of
      satisfaction. &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a gentleman! When you come again, sir,
      ask for me&mdash;my name is Maybee: everybody here knows Josh Maybee,
      anything I can do for you <i>in</i> the prison I will: out of it, you
      know, is not at present in my line. God bless you, sir! good day&mdash;oh!
      stay, you had better knock and see whether Mr. Wilton is in his room. If
      not, I&rsquo;ll run into the ground, and hunt him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora tapped gently at the door, but there was no response. She turned the
      handle of the lock gently, and opened it a little way. She looked into the
      apartment with a throbbing heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a bed she saw seated her father&mdash;the very picture of desolation
      and woe. His head was bowed almost to his knees, and his two hands were
      spread open over his forehead. He seemed unconscious of everything but the
      intense anguish under the influence of which his body was swaying to and
      fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora ran into the room: she sank upon her knees at his feet: she drew
      gently his hands from before his eyes, and twined her arms about him with
      a sweet tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, dear father!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;look up: see, your own Flo&rsquo; has come to
      you&mdash;to be with you&mdash;to share your prison&mdash;to tend you, and
      to be a comfort to you as she was at home. Look at me&mdash;speak to me,
      father dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a startled cry, the old man looked up, as if suddenly roused out of a
      dream of gloom and horror into a paradise of sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught Flora&rsquo;s soft cheeks between his withered hands, and gazed upon
      her young, bright, lovely face with an expression of passionate joy
      lighting up his wrinkled, pallid, grief-furrowed features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flo&rsquo;!&rdquo; he cried, hysterically, &ldquo;Flo&rsquo;! Flo&rsquo;! my&mdash;my Flo&rsquo;, not dead,
      not consumed! my own Flo, not lost to me for ever! Oh, beneficent Creator!
      I can bear all now: my sorrows are assuaged. Come what come may, I care
      not, for my child is spared to me. To my heart, my darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew her to his breast, and pressed her convulsively there,
      sobbing, as he did so, like a child. Hal, with water glittering in his
      eyes, turned his face from them, and looked out upon the bustling noisy
      groups in the racket ground beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shabby Josh Maybee made an effort to clear his throat, as if he had
      swallowed a cobweb, and felt that, in spite of all his economic
      resolutions, at least twopence of the half-crown would instantly be melted
      into beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He darted away down the stone staircase, two steps at a time, with the
      practised agility of one who had descended them many hundred times. As
      soon as Flora could disengage herself from her father&rsquo;s embrace, she drew
      his attention to Hal, who had all the time modestly remained close to the
      threshold of the door. In glowing terms she related to him the part which
      he had played in the dreadful fire, the origin of which was a mystery. She
      told him of the desperate hazard he had incurred in his efforts to save
      her life, and she also related to him what had since occurred. Old Wilton,
      with tears in his eyes, thanked him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vivian,&rdquo; he said feebly, &ldquo;the day may be distant, but I have faith
      that it will come, when I shall in some degree be able to repay you for
      the past: not that salvation of a life can ever be meetly rewarded, but
      something in the direction may be achieved&mdash;some service may be
      needed by you, and it may be in my power to render it; it will show, at
      least, the spirit of my gratefulness towards you. Mr. Vivian, I have not
      always been the abject wretch you now see me; I may not continue to be
      such. Ah! my God!&rdquo; he cried, putting his hands to his forehead, as though
      smitten with sudden agony, and then, turning to his astonished daughter,
      who was regarding him with an affrighted look, he said, in a tone of
      unutterable anguish&mdash;&ldquo;everything was hopelessly, utterly destroyed in
      that dreadful fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands, bowed her head, and replied, sorrowfully&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He groaned bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire was so sudden and so violent,&rdquo; observed Hal, gently, &ldquo;even those
      who escaped had hardly time to save themselves in their night dresses&mdash;opportunity
      was barely afforded for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man rose up, and paced the room, murmuring, in accents of acute
      misery&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All gone, all gone, the long cherished hope of years&mdash;the one link
      which, through all my misery, has bound me to life. Everything has
      perished&mdash;my long, long sustained hopefulness is swept from me, and
      henceforth there is nothing left but misery and despair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, dear father, do not give way to such gloomy fears,&rdquo; cried Flora,
      tenderly caressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cloud has long hung over our house; it is at its darkest now, but it
      will disperse and pass away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! never!&rdquo; cried the old man, hoarsely. &ldquo;In that dread fire, all our
      expectations&mdash;all the possibilities of restoring them, are consumed;
      we might have been wealthy in the time to come, now we must be beggars for
      ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sorrows overpower your better reason, Mr. Wilton,&rdquo; exclaimed Hal,
      pained to see the acute grief of the old man, and the sharp tears of
      anguish coursing down the cheeks of Flora, whom he seemed to love more
      deeply and fervently each time his eye traced the exquisite beauty of her
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know not the extent of my loss, Mr. Vivian,&rdquo; he said, almost sharply,
      &ldquo;you cannot, therefore, measure the depth of my grief.&rdquo; Then, addressing
      his daughter, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! my child, I am to blame that I did not
      confide to you the true value of that document which I charged you to
      guard with your life. Had I done so you would&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved that packet,&rdquo; cried Flora, eagerly interrupting him. &ldquo;I
      returned for it at the last moment, and I should have died when I secured
      it, had not Mr. Vivian risked his life to follow me, and bear me through
      flame and smoke to a place of safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned a soft glance upon Hal as she said this, which made his heart
      leap again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton stood speechless, staring upon her as if distraught while she
      spoke. As she concluded, he said, in a hoarse whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it? where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew from beneath her mantle a small packet, and handed it to him. He
      clutched it with trembling fingers. He ran his eye eagerly over it, though
      it shook in his hands, so that to decipher a word of that which was
      written in endorsement upon it seemed impossible. His breath went and came
      in short convulsive sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same!&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;it is the same! Saved!&mdash;saved! My
      Flo&rsquo;, saved!&rdquo; The last words sounded feebly, and he staggered as if he was
      about to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal rushed forward and caught him in his arms. The emotion had been too
      much for him, and he had fallen into a swoon. Hal laid him tenderly on his
      bed, and unloosed his neckcloth, while Flora, procuring some water from a
      brown pitcher, which stood in a corner of the apartment, bathed his
      temples and his lips with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some anxious moments, spent in the endeavour to restore him, he
      heaved a deep sigh, and opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell upon his daughter&rsquo;s face close to his own. Her soft arm was his
      pillow, and her gentle hand wiped the clammy dew from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better, dearest father?&rdquo; she asked, in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better! better!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;Well! happy! saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her cheek to his, and they mingled their tears together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal knew they had much to say to each other, private matters to
      communicate, the past to speak about, and the future to arrange. In such
      communion, he felt that he would only be an intruder, and he availed
      himself of the situation to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would gladly be alone with your father, Miss Wilton. You have much to
      talk over of importance which my presence would render embarrassing to
      both. I feel a curiosity to watch the proceedings below. I will return for
      you in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait for the answer, but quitted the room, closing the door
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good and generous youth,&rdquo; exclaimed old Wilton, gazing after him,
      &ldquo;would that all the world were like him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora echoed the sentiment, but in silence. Perhaps, too, she had her
      thoughts concerning him; or why did her full lid droop as the sound of his
      descending footstep gradually lost itself in the echoes of the vaulted
      passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Harry Vivian entered the quadrangle where were assembled the &ldquo;benchers&rdquo;
       and their friends and satellites, he gazed around upon the noisy, active
      throng, uncertain whither to bend his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He impulsively strolled towards the farther end of the quadrangle, where
      racket-playing was going on vigorously. As he moved on, his eye suddenly
      caught sight of the dark, military looking personage who had so rudely
      stared at Flora Wilton, and whom he had so unceremoniously ejected from
      his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in close conversation with old Josh Maybee, and twice or thrice
      during their conversation he pointed to No. 10, and Josh Maybee pointed
      there, too&mdash;even up at the window of No. 5, where Flora was with her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for an instant did Hal doubt that Flora was the subject of their
      conversation. It was so natural for him to surmise it. The moustached man
      had stared at her in the most marked manner&mdash;impertinently and
      rudely, as Hal believed. He was struck with her beauty&mdash;that was
      certain; he could hardly be to blame for that&mdash;how could he help it?
      But there the matter ought to end. Why was he making inquiries about her,
      as it was very evident he was? Why should he desire to know who and what
      she was? Perhaps he wished to see her again, and to speak to her. Nothing
      more probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Hal&rsquo;s calculation of consequences, he thought he had better
      not make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes thus occupied, the tall, dark gentleman left Josh
      Maybee, and walked as if in deep thought towards the end of the
      quadrangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josh Maybee hurried with a smiling face towards the doorway, where Hal was
      yet standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have passed, but Hal caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want a word with you, Maybee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty, if you please, young sir,&rdquo; cried Maybee, who appeared quite
      excited. &ldquo;You have been lucky to me to-day, sir. Just had a crown given to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess who gave it to you&mdash;a tall, dark man with whom you were just
      now speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same,&rdquo; returned Maybee, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it fair to ask the subject of your conversation?&rdquo; observed Hal,
      hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Maybee, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t caution me to keep what was said
      to myself. He asked me, first of all, who was that pretty girl&mdash;and,
      dear heart! she has a blessed sweet face&mdash;that was with you, sir. And
      I told him that I didn&rsquo;t know. Then he gave me a crown piece, which I put
      away quickly, for fear he should ask for change or to have it back again.
      Ah! there aint many crowns and half-crowns given away here, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Hal, impatiently, &ldquo;that was not all that passed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you! no, sir!&rdquo; returned Maybee, turning the crown over the
      half-crown, and the half-crown over the crown in his pocket. &ldquo;No, he asked
      me where I conducted you to? I told him 5 in 10. He asked the name of the
      gentleman you went to visit? I told him &lsquo;Wilton.&rsquo; Then he asked me if I
      knew anything about Mr. Wilton? and I told him no. Was he a scientific
      man? I said I didn&rsquo;t know. Had he come up from the country? I couldn&rsquo;t
      tell him. He asked me a good many more such questions, but I couldn&rsquo;t
      answer him. Then he said he was himself an Indian officer, and had not
      long returned; he had been away a long, long time he said; but he knew a
      Mr. Wilton before he went away, and he wondered if he were the same. Of
      course I told him that I could not answer that question; and then he
      wished to know the room, and I pointed it out to him, that&rsquo;s all, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he mention his own name?&rdquo; inquired Hal, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he merely said he was an officer just returned from India,
      nothing more,&rdquo; responded Maybee, who felt more disposed for the
      twopennyworth of beer he had promised himself than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal let him go. In less than a minute Mr. Maybee was at the bar and a
      foaming pint was placed before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal walked up and down, reflecting upon this event.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked after the Indian officer, but he had disappeared, and though he
      remained in the quadrangle the time he had prescribed for himself to
      remain away from Wilton&rsquo;s apartments, he saw nothing more of the man with
      whom he had come into collision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour having passed, he ascended the stairs with a light step, and
      paused before the door of No. 5. He fancied he heard voices within, and
      knocked gently for admission. His summons was, perhaps, not heard, and he
      repeated it louder. In the interval he was convinced that there were
      voices which he did not recognise, and this lent a greater firmness to his
      knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard old Wilton&rsquo;s voice exclaim, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a little surprised on advancing into the room to perceive the
      Indian officer, accompanied by a young, dashingly dressed fellow, seated
      far too near to Flora to be agreeable to him. Old Wilton was standing, and
      displayed an air of dignity, which Hal, certainly, had never seen him wear
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence upon his entrance, and the Indian officer gazed upon
      him grimly. Old Wilton, however, with a pleasant smile, and the manner of
      a gentleman, motioned him to a seat, and then, turning to the officer,
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to ask of you, Mr. Wilton, whether you ever lived in
      Devonshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, before I reply, permitted to ask your motive in questioning me?
      You, a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably. I have just returned from India after an absence&mdash;with
      one short exception&mdash;-of seventeen years. One of my first objects, on
      arriving in England, on retiring from the service, has been to find out
      those old friends, dwelling in this country, who, in my early years, were
      kind and generous in their conduct to me. Among those I can so class, was
      a gentleman of the name of Wilton, who dwelt at Harleydale Manor, Devon. A
      chance glance at that young lady&rsquo;s exquisite face awakened memories long
      since slumbering, and the accidental mention of your name, in connection
      with it, led me to seek you to ask whether you are Eustace Wilton, of
      Harleydale Manor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton&rsquo;s lip quivered; he drew himself up erect, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer rose to his feet, and grasped his hand, shaking it with great
      apparent warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time has wrought great changes in us both,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am Colonel Mires
      of the Bengal army&mdash;that same Ensign Mires whom you defended at a
      moment when honour, reputation, family, life itself were at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton started as the name fell upon his ears; he raised his eyes to
      the face of the officer, and appeared to scan every lineament. Then,
      uttering an exclamation of wonder, he released his hand from the grip of
      the colonel, and sank into his seat with an air of stupefaction.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>elen Grahame, with
      her hand tightly clutching the wrist of the young man with whom she had
      been in such tender converse, retreated noiselessly into the deepest
      shadows of the small thicket where they had met, and there stood with her
      companion, as the Honorable Lester Vane advanced, motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though greatly agitated by the unexpected appearance of her brother&rsquo;s
      guest in the garden at such a moment, she betrayed no outward sign of
      emotion. She could hear the beating of her heart, but, by an almost
      superhuman exertion, she was calm, collected, prepared for action, if
      discovered, and even in such an emergency could have spoken without any
      visible symptom of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Lester Vane paused before the cluster of trees; he even took
      a step or two as though to enter its recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, had he but advanced one foot more, would have emerged from her
      place of concealment, and with some ready excuse for being there, have led
      him away, so that her companion might have escaped unobserved, but, as if
      satisfied that it possessed no outlet, he turned away and sauntered slowly
      and thoughtfully down the gravelled path by a separate route to that by
      which he had approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was out of hearing, Helen turned to her companion,
      exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave you, Hugh, and at once&mdash;nay, dearest, do not urge me to
      remain; you know what happiness it would be to me to share your dear
      society for hours&mdash;would it were for ever!&mdash;but it would be
      madness to risk discovery for a few minutes of stolen felicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I cannot part from you thus,&rdquo; returned the youth at her side, in a
      voice trembling with emotion. &ldquo;I am quitting London&mdash;you know it&mdash;possibly
      by dawn in the morning; and these may be the last few precious moments I
      may pass with you for a long and dreary term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you will soon return, Hugh,&rdquo; she said, with a seeming conviction
      that his absence would be brief. He shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what are the intentions of my uncle with respect to my
      future movements,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I know only that I am ordered to be in
      readiness to proceed at a minute&rsquo;s notice to Southampton, there to await
      further instructions, and to be prepared for the possibility of having to
      undertake a far more distant journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more distant journey, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I have very powerful reasons for believing that my destination is
      India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation burst from the lips of the young girl. A thousand thoughts
      flashed through her brain at the vision of a long separation from him who
      now addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! for Hugh&mdash;they were not such thoughts as he could have wished
      to occupy her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would regret his departure unquestionably: but it brought with it a
      sense of liberty, a freedom of action, an unquestioned license for
      listening to soft words from other lips, and for responding to meaning
      glances from admiring eyes, without the dullness of indifference or a
      flash of scorn. The suggestion of a protracted separation brought more
      strongly before her mind the ducal coronet of the young peer, now in her
      father&rsquo;s mansion, and the impressive eyes of Lester Vane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. Her mind was too busy to permit her to speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had involuntarily uttered an exclamation when he revealed his fear
      that he was about to leave England for a lengthened term, and he
      attributed her subsequent silence to the grief he presumed she would
      necessarily feel at the occurrence of an event which, to him, was
      distracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He twined his arms about her waist, and she rested her beautiful face upon
      his shoulder. He pressed the lips thus offered up to his own, and, with a
      groan of agony, murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen! my own noble beautiful one, my life&rsquo;s treasure, it will be
      death to me to part with you. I cannot, will not, go: I will submit to any
      sacrifice rather. I will not be torn from you, for, in truth, it will
      break my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, dearest, do not give way thus,&rdquo; she rejoined, as her youthful
      companion, under the intense pressure of his feelings, suffered his head
      to fall upon her neck, and sobbed passionately; &ldquo;this is not like you,
      Hugh: I have seen you brave enough in desperate peril&mdash;come, be brave
      now. Remember you are making yourself unhappy upon a surmise only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I could view it only as a surmise, Helen,&rdquo; he returned, sadly.
      &ldquo;Unhappily, I have too much occasion for faith in the presentiment which
      oppresses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere childishness, Hugh! We have parted before, but only to meet again,
      and with increased happiness. You quitted me hopefully, you have returned
      to me joyously; why not again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear, Helen,&rdquo; he said, raising up his head, and dashing away the
      tear which yet trembled on his cheek, &ldquo;that you can contemplate a
      separation with calmness and firmness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In expectation of meeting you soon again, certainly,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      His quick ear detected a slight coolness, and a little impatience in the
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in expectation of not soon meeting again?&rdquo; he asked, sharply and with
      misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why imagine that which is not likely to happen?&rdquo; she returned, pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you that it <i>will</i> happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, I do not comprehend what of late has possessed you,&rdquo; she retorted
      in the same fretful voice. &ldquo;You have suffered the most ridiculous fancies
      and chimeras to seize upon your brain, and you not only make yourself
      miserable, but you seem to wish to compel everybody else to become so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, you wrong me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I fear I do not. Even to-night, when you must have been conscious
      that to accomplish a meeting with you was to me next to an impossibility,
      you insisted upon my complying with your request, and you bring me here
      only to entertain me with a string of doubts and fears, which are not
      worthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started, and released her hand, of which, until now, he had retained
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love me, Helen!&rdquo; he exclaimed, passionately, as he recoiled
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not love you, Hugh,&rdquo; she replied, throwing up her head angrily; &ldquo;you are
      ungrateful, sir. Ask your reason. At what sacrifice have I paused for you?
      You, at least, have had proof that my love for you was of no ordinary
      character; you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen!&rdquo; he cried falling upon his knees before her, &ldquo;pardon me,
      forgive me! I am frenzied at the prospect of losing you. I do love you so
      fondly, so dearly, so madly, that death in any shape seems to me
      preferable to being torn from you for years. You are my heart&rsquo;s idol, its
      worship&mdash;my adoration; and if I am captious, full of strange
      conceptions and dread misgivings, attribute it alone to my passion for
      you, my Helen, my beloved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is rarely that a young girl who is possessed of genuine tenderness of
      feeling for a young and handsome man, remains an indifferent listener to
      his ardent expressions of passionate devotion. Helen Grahame was not less
      susceptible in this particular than the weakest of her sex. She bent over
      Hugh, parted with her soft white hand his rich glossy hair from his
      forehead, and pressed it with her ruby lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, Hugh, rise,&rdquo; she said, fondly and earnestly, &ldquo;I entreat you. Pray,
      be more calm. Elevate yourself above this morbid feeling of unhappiness,
      and let me hear what you have to communicate to me, for indeed I must
      almost instantly return to the house. I am expected in the drawing-room,
      and, if missed, a messenger will be sent in search of me. I would not for
      worlds be discovered here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen dearest.&rdquo; he exclaimed with a quivering lip as he rose to his feet
      and once more twined his arms about her graceful form, &ldquo;I leave London
      to-morrow&mdash;I know not yet at what hour&mdash;for Southampton; if that
      were to be the limit of my journey I should not be thus depressed, but
      from a confidential source I have received the hint that I shall be called
      upon to proceed by the overland route, to India&mdash;to the city of Agra.
      I believe this is decided; our separation cannot, therefore, be less than
      for six months; it may be for years&mdash;it is this thought which wounds
      me so deeply, for what may not happen in my absence? What indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment, overpowered by a throng of painful anticipations.
      Helen remained perfectly silent; and clearing his voice he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot ask you not to forget me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know that would be
      impossible, but&mdash;but I would ask you, Helen&mdash;I would ask you,
      when I am gone far, far hence, to remember what we have been to each
      other, and to continue to me as, I vow to Heaven I will ever to you remain&mdash;true,
      loving, and faithful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark&rdquo; cried Helen, starting suddenly, &ldquo;a footstep approaches&mdash;I must
      fly. Farewell, Hugh! God bless you, and guard you until we meet again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself into his arms. He strained her passionately to his
      breast, and imprinted a thousand fervid kisses on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be true to me, Helen?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Hugh, I will,&rdquo; she replied with an earnestness rivalling his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear it, dear Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do! I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One more passionate embrace, many murmured but heart-spoken farewells, a
      long&mdash;long kiss, then she broke hastily from his arms, darted swiftly
      into the deep shadows of the over-arching trees, flitted like a phantom
      over the grassy lawn, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a melancholy gaze he caught the last wave of her white garments, as
      they vanished in the distance and in the darkness, and then, with a deep
      sigh, he proceeded slowly to quit the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere he had proceeded a dozen yards, a hand was placed somewhat vigorously
      upon his shoulder. He turned quickly: the figure of a man was before him,
      but in the darkness he could distinguish nothing further.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice he did not recognise said, roughly, to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow! why are you lurking here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh flung him fiercely hack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you who dare thus address me?&rdquo; he cried, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you shall know somewhat too soon for your satisfaction,&rdquo; returned
      his questioner, again seizing him, and, with great strength, dragging him
      from the thicket towards the gravel path. &ldquo;The lady, too,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;can
      hardly escape detection. I have marked her down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More he was unable to say, for the impetuous bands of Hugh clutched his
      throat, and prevented further utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A desperate struggle ensued. It was so far but a wrestle. Hugh sought to
      release himself from the grip of him who had seized him, and his captor
      did his utmost to retain his hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the contention they emerged from the thicket into the
      moonlight, which fell upon the faces of both; each was thus able to
      distinguish clearly the features of his antagonist, but both were utter
      strangers to each other; simultaneously they detected they had not met
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Riversdale knew not that he was striving with Lester Vane, but he was
      sure that he should never forget the face, the pallid face, within a foot
      of his own, which the gray moonlight was tinting with the hue of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Lester Vane fear he should fail to remember the features of one
      whom he instantly perceived was strikingly handsome and no common
      personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his strength failing him, that Hugh would succeed in releasing
      himself from his custody, and he shouted loudly for help. The next instant
      he received a tremendous blow upon the temple, and was hurled to the
      ground with such force as to compel him to remain there stunned and
      insensible. Hugh cast a glance upon him as he lay motionless upon the
      gravel path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen that face in a dream.&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;mine enemy from
      henceforward. We have for the first time crossed each other&rsquo;s path&mdash;we
      shall again. Woe to him who stumbles on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sounds of persons running along the garden walk caught his ear at this
      moment. Servants, roused by the shouts of Lester Vane, were hastening to
      his assistance. Hugh plunged into the thicket, vaulted over the iron
      fencing upon the edge of the ornamental waters, plunged into the winding
      canal, and swimming briskly but noiselessly beneath the shadows of some
      weeping willows, continued his progress until he reached a bend of the
      stream, not visible from Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s garden; and then, emerging from the
      water, he disappeared among the thick cluster of trees which there lined
      its banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the form of Lester Vane, lying insensible, was
      discovered by two or three male servants, under the direction of Whelks.
      During the race from the house, he was absolutely last in it, but on
      finding that there was no enemy to encounter, he exhibited the most
      reckless display of daring, and rushed to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly his pale green eyes fell upon the prostrate form of Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s
      guest, he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my &rsquo;evens! if it isn&rsquo;t the &rsquo;onerbbel Mr. Lester Wane!
      Grashus! Is it the wine &rsquo;es overcom &rsquo;im, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said one of the servants, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got a hugly bump on his forrid; a
      precious whack that! Somebody about here must ha&rsquo; given it him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some owdashus thief, no doubt,&rdquo; suggested Whelks, with a swift glance
      over his left shoulder at the clump of trees, and a shudder which lifted
      his scalp, and pained him in the heels. &ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; he added, quickly to
      the man who had just spoken, &ldquo;you &rsquo;elp me to carry Mr. Lester
      Wane&rsquo;s corpse&mdash;if he is a corpse&mdash;into the &rsquo;ouse, and
      you, Cussinks,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the other servant, &ldquo;you dash into
      that clump o&rsquo; trees, and &rsquo;unt about for the beggler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whelks and Jackson hurried on with their burden, and &ldquo;Cussinks,&rdquo; declining
      the verb to search proposed by Whelks, sallied out for that gallant
      official, the policeman, who is supposed to know no fear, and to be ever
      ready to seize the most ferocious ruffian in existence with the same
      promptness with which he would attack cold mutton down a deep area.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the house was gained by this little party, Mr. Grahame had
      been alarmed. With his son Malcolm and the Duke of St. Allborne he was
      hastening to the garden, when he encountered Whelks and Jackson bearing
      the body of Lester Vane. Almost at the same moment, the injured young man
      aroused from the stupor into which the blow he had received had flung him,
      recovered his feet, and gazed round him with an astonished air. He looked
      into the many eager faces bent upon his own, without recognising any of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of St. Allborne laid his hand upon his shoulder, and shook him,
      saying, at the same moment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vane, wecovaw youawself, my good fellah. We aw all fwiends. I&rsquo;m St.
      Allborne&mdash;don&rsquo;t you wecog-nise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice brought back the absent recollection of Lester
      Vane. He put his hand over his eyes, as though to collect his thoughts,
      and then he exclaimed hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember all now&mdash;all, distinctly, clearly.&rdquo; He looked up, and
      addressing Mr. Grahame, he said&mdash;&ldquo;My dear sir, if you will allow me
      to retire for a few minutes to collect myself, I will join you with the
      ladies in the drawing-room, where I will relate to you the strange
      incident in which I have, I believe, borne the worst part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Vane,&rdquo; responded Mr. Grahame quickly, &ldquo;the attack you have
      suffered&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was made by no common individual, Mr. Grahame! one who is by this time, I
      have no doubt, far beyond pursuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the object, Mr. Vane?&rdquo; observed Mr. Grahame, with an air of mystified
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither plunder nor violence,&rdquo; returned Lester Vane, adding hastily&mdash;&ldquo;Pray
      interrogate me no further now. A few minutes hence, and I will relate all
      that occurred. I beg now to be allowed to retire to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame bowed, and directed Whelks to show Mr. Vane to his chamber,
      while he, with the Duke and Malcolm, his son, took their way to the
      drawing-room, talking over the mysterious event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies had entered the room a moment before them, and they now heard
      from the gentlemen, with astonishment, that the Honorable Lester Vane,
      walking in the garden, had been suddenly attacked and felled to the earth
      by some unknown assailant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the least astounded of the party present was Helen Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed from her heart to her brain; she felt as though a
      thousand bells were ringing in her ears. Then the life-stream swept back
      to her heart, leaving her as cold as death&mdash;and as colourless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Riversdale and Lester Vane had encountered each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had passed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first impulse was to dart out of the room&mdash;the house, and flee
      anywhere&mdash;anywhere!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next, to remain where she was, face all that might be brought forward
      to crush her for ever, and to deny every charge firmly, steadfastly; even
      to deny Hugh Riversdale, if in custody he were brought forward to confront
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! that she could only know what had actually occurred, so that she might
      be prepared to enact the part it would be best for her to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did Lester Vane refuse to explain what had happened, when he first
      recovered, in Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s presence? Why did he defer it until all were
      assembled in the drawing-room? Did he know that she had had an interview
      with Hugh Riversdale?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was remarkable, and much disturbed her. Yet if he did know that she
      had a clandestine meeting with his assailant, he could surely entertain no
      feeling of animosity towards her&mdash;that seemed impossible. The
      acquaintance of an hour could hardly have raised up in his breast a wish
      to injure her. Yet why did he pursue the strange course of refusing to
      relate what had passed, unless he knew she would be present to hear the
      recital?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her anxious surmises were the suspicions that haunted a guilty mind, for
      she had no just reason to believe that he would connect her with the
      mystery at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was perplexed, disconcerted, plunged into an agony of mind, as she
      pursued this train of reasoning. Still she saw the imperious necessity of
      appearing calm, collected, and full of wonder only, to the extent she
      would have been had she had no further share in the event than her sister
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an effort of her will, she knew she could achieve this much, and she
      resolved to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she formed the resolution, the door opened, and Lester Vane entered. He
      was pale; there was a slight wound on his forehead, strapped up, but
      otherwise he was as self-possessed, and had the same cold smile playing
      upon his lips as when first he entered the sitting-room in the earlier
      part of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of pain ran through the frame of Helen as she felt his large,
      dark eye settle upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a sudden sense of her danger roused her to exertion, and she forced
      down all outward sign of the conflict going on within her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her glittering eyes slowly but full upon Lester Vane&rsquo;s. Met him
      on his own battle-field, and drove him back, for her gaze was so firm and
      unwavering, that he turned his eyes, after a searching glance at her, upon
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      All crowded round him save Evangeline, who, as usual, sat quietly and
      unobtrusively in a retired part of the room&mdash;if there was, in that
      brilliantly lighted apartment, such a spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was among the first of those who called upon Lester Vane to explain
      the remarkable affair which had had so unpleasant a termination for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her inquiries were dictated by the most intense desire to ascertain if her
      suspicions were correct, but her acting was a masterpiece; it had the air
      of a very natural curiosity only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordeal, however, was yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      By general request, eagerly urged, Lester Vane commenced his recital.
      Helen perceived that he closely and scrutinisingly perused her features
      while he spoke, and a strange feeling took sudden possession of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a contemptuous consciousness of a superiority in the power of
      deception. She knew that he was trying to read what was passing within her
      heart. She applied herself to the task of baffling him, feeling that she
      could accomplish it with ease. It was her first direct essay in simulation
      under strong pressure, but she went to the task with the skill of a
      practised adept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunning is not alone an art&mdash;it is necessarily a part of human
      organisation: but to become subtle and refined, it requires to be
      cultivated with careful discrimination, and to be pursued with merciless
      indifference to the feelings of the object upon whom it is exercised. The
      crafty rarely fails to detect the crafty, unless the more crafty with
      consummate ability assumes genuine simplicity&mdash;then as there appears
      to be nothing to guard against, cunning is to be effectively deceived by
      an affectation of its absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen never troubled herself to reason upon the point, though she had
      plenty of natural shrewdness to have reached this conclusion, if she had
      addressed her mind to the task. She was naturally an accomplished actress,
      and with no great effort could have seemed as full of natural wonderment
      at what had happened as her sisters Margaret and Evangeline, but she
      decided upon adopting a defiant aspect&mdash;one which should say to Vane,
      &ldquo;You seek by an attempt to confuse me with your steadfast gaze, to compel
      me to make an admission&mdash;I defy you.&rdquo; It was a mistake, because that
      look at once raised up an impression in his mind that she had something to
      conceal&mdash;that though she listened to his story attentively, met his
      gaze at certain parts of the recital unflinchingly, made remarks, and put
      questions&mdash;all tending to disconnect her with any share in the
      transaction&mdash;she was in some degree mixed up with, if she was not one
      of, the principal actors in the little drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that Evangeline exhibited emotions of distress and confusion,
      but he detected in her conduct no sign of guilt, nothing by which he could
      presume her to have been a participator in the scene he believed himself
      to have disturbed, if even she were a confidante; but Helen, by her
      manner, challenged his suspicions, and, as it appeared to him, laughed
      them to scorn; yet in doing so, gave him reason to form a conviction that
      they were well grounded. He set his teeth, and felt the blood mount to his
      sallow features.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but for a moment, and he became as pale as before, but he
      determined to apply himself to the task of making himself master of
      Helen&rsquo;s secret, and by its possession master of her, to be used as his own
      selfish interests might dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He related to his marvelling auditors how he had escaped from the dining
      room to allay the heat of his fevered blood in the cool air which had been
      playing among the fragrant flower-beds, and sighing through the graceful
      trees in the elegantly arranged garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of effect, the speaker adopted a poetical style of narration,
      not without success upon the majority of his listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lip of Helen curled; to her the chosen language was another proof of
      this man&rsquo;s art, and she scarcely attempted to disguise from him that such
      was her impression. A sense of her estimate of his display, added only to
      the intensity of his resolve to obtain entire power over her, that he
      might make her endure tenfold the annoyance&mdash;it was something more&mdash;which
      she made him suffer now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not quite comprehend why they so suddenly stood in an
      antagonistic position to each other. It was enough for him that they did
      so, and that he believed that he should be able to avenge himself upon one
      who viewed him in a light insulting to his vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding with his tale, he said that, as he slowly paced the gravelled
      walk in the broad moonlight, he fancied that he heard the murmur of voices
      in a retired part of the garden; low and subdued, in truth, but still he
      was struck by the peculiarity of the sound, which was that of two persons
      in secret conference. He gained the spot from whence it appeared to come,
      and found himself fronting a small cluster of trees, into which he
      directed his gaze; but, not observing any figure or sign of a human being,
      he assured himself that he had been deceived, that he had mistaken the
      soft bubbling of the flowing waters beyond for tones of the human voice.
      He continued his walk; but he had not proceeded far ere the sounds which
      had previously attracted his attention were renewed. The position he had
      gained enabled him to command a view of the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed his deep, dark eyes upon Helen as he arrived at this part of his
      narrative, but her eyelid never wavered, nor did her face undergo any
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself baffled for a moment&mdash;then he went on to say that he
      retraced his footsteps, and when near the clump of trees paused, with the
      intent of catching, if possible, some of the words which passed between
      the two persons who were engaged in such deep and earnest conversation.
      Not, he added, hastily, as he saw the eye of Helen glitter with scorn, to
      play the part of a paltry eaves-dropper, but to ascertain whether he had
      unconsciously encountered a couple of enamoured servants deep in a
      love-passage&mdash;with what withering emphasis he used those words!&mdash;or
      had detected a brace of thieves in the act of concerting measures to rob
      the house of Mr. Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      While standing irresolute as to the steps he should take, a female emerged
      from the thicket, and fled past him towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards my house!&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, elevating his eyebrows with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; cried Lester Vane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely she did not enter it?&rdquo; he cried, his eyes sparkling with fury; &ldquo;no
      shameless person world dare&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My impression is,&rdquo; said Lester, observing how intently, and with what
      remarkable self-possession Helen regarded him, &ldquo;that she disappeared in
      the shrubbery in front of the house. I cannot be positive, for the next
      moment I was in contact with her companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Helen&rsquo;s face was rigid, her features composed, and her eye steadily
      fixed upon his. But there was no expression of wonder upon her
      countenance, as upon that of all the rest. What more needed Lester to tell
      him that it was she whom he had seen flitting from the grove of trees
      across the garden to the house, and that she held secret meetings with
      some person unknown to her family?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this wretch&mdash;this insolent scoundrel,&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, &ldquo;you
      fastened upon him, I presume, and thus was most murderously assaulted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lester Vane, speaking slowly, and with distinctness, &ldquo;the
      moonlight fell upon his face&mdash;that I saw clearly and well defined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would know it again?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amid a million faces,&rdquo; he answered, between his teeth, and then added:
      &ldquo;He was a common-looking person, and I should have let him pass, but he
      made a desperate blow at me, although he did not utter a word. I avoided
      his first attack, and collared him, determined to punish him for his
      cowardly and dastardly conduct. I called for assistance, as I had no
      intention of entering into a personal conflict with a low ruffian about
      whom I knew nothing, but he inflicted upon my forehead a blow with some
      weapon which rendered me insensible. And so ends my history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most monstrous!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, with an air of indignant pride.
      &ldquo;I never heard of such an outrage. You can describe the man, Mr. Vane, so
      that the police may be able to track him, and take him into custody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, accurately,&rdquo; replied Lester, &ldquo;but not to-night. My head aches, and
      the task would be an annoyance&mdash;to-morrow with pleasure, but to-night
      excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the creature with this desperate person&mdash;could you not, my dear
      Mr. Vane, describe her&mdash;if it were only her attire?&rdquo; urged Mr.
      Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be in the house,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Grahame, feeling that a deadly
      outrage had been committed upon the family pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be in the house,&rdquo; returned Lester, with a peculiar glance
      directed to Helen; &ldquo;all I can inform you, in reply to your question, is
      that her dress was of some light fabric, but as she fled past me like a
      phantom, I was not able to observe her sufficiently well to give a
      description of the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Grahame, in a tone of immeasurable
      contempt. &ldquo;To-morrow, Mr. Grahame, this strange affair must be thoroughly
      sifted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mrs. Grahame, it shall be,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How widiculously womantic, Miss Gwahame,&rdquo; laughed the Duke of St.
      Allborne, addressing Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen started as he spoke. She had listened to the sneering sarcasms of
      Lester, and to her mother&rsquo;s expressions of withering contempt, as though
      she had been exposed to an atmosphere of flame, and was bound to endure
      its tremendous torture without one sob of pain. But, great as was her
      agony, her thoughts would fly away with her to him who had occasioned this
      scene. She was, therefore, thankful to the Duke for thus checking an
      absence of mind, which might have excited attention and caused remark. She
      replied to him with a vivacity which somewhat astonished Lester Vane,
      though it helped to confirm the suspicions he entertained connecting her
      with the interview in the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She adroitly contrived to place the affair in a ridiculous light, without
      openly giving cause of offence to him; because, with affected sympathy,
      she deplored the injury he had received; but she went so far as to cause
      him to observe, with a sickly smile&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, Miss Grahame, <i>you</i> conceive that the affair, after all,
      was a mere fancy, occasioned by the fatigues of my journey to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the stwength of our fwiend Gwahame&rsquo;s fine old pawt,&rdquo; exclaimed the
      Duke, with a loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame instantly took Helen to task in so serious and so stately a
      manner, that Lester Vane interfered to obtain pardon for her, which was
      granted, at his instance, in a manner that mortified her only more
      bitterly than she had yet been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring him a suppliant to my feet,&rdquo; she said, mentally, as her
      eyes, sparkling like a star, fastened upon him, &ldquo;and when he is prostrate,
      abject, I&rsquo;ll crush him remorselessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next evening, Helen and Lester were walking in the garden together.
      She had already begun to weave her web round him, and he seemed likely to
      become so enmeshed as never more to escape from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, when near the ornamental water, he paused. He drew from his
      breast a small but exquisitely fine cambric handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Grahame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I betray any impertinent
      curiosity, but I am desirous of knowing whether you are acquainted with
      this handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it. In a corner, embroidered, were the initials &ldquo;H. G.&rdquo; It
      was her own, and one of value. She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I ought to know it well, Mr. Vane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it beneath a tree, there,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the thicket in
      which she had parted with Hugh Riversdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, no doubt, dropped it on leaving Hugh the night before. She felt
      an acute pain run through her brain, as she saw in what direction his
      finger pointed, and that as he spoke his eyes were absolutely glaring upon
      her. She detected, in an instant, how much depended upon her answer.
      Controlling, as before, with a remarkable exertion of self-will, the
      expression of her features, she assumed an air of indifference, and
      flinging the handkerchief into the stream, upon the brink of which she was
      standing, she answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly; it is one I some time since gave to my maid, Chayter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester was unable to utter a word in reply; he was baffled. He watched the
      handkerchief float away, and he said to himself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it was you who stood last night in the thicket along with the fellow
      who felled me to the earth. Despite this check, I will proye it, and to
      you.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he emotion
      displayed by old Wilton when Colonel Mires made himself known to him by
      reference to an incident which had occurred to him at a period now long
      past, was a mystery to the two persons likely to be best acquainted with
      its source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, who flew to her father&rsquo;s aid, marvelled at it, and the Indian
      colonel wondered no less. Flora knew nothing, however, of the event
      alluded to, as her father had not suffered mention of it to escape his
      lips; but Colonel Mires, from whom some emotion might perhaps have been
      expected while recurring to it, having been a principal actor in a
      circumstance of a remarkable nature could find in a rapid review of what
      had then occurred no cause for Wilton to be thus suddenly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilton had been called upon to render a great, a valuable, and
      disinterested service, he had performed it nobly, because it then seemed
      he was in nowise personally interested or affected by the result; why,
      therefore, he should now appear overcome by his feelings somewhat
      staggered the Colonel, and set him cogitating. Perhaps, after all, there
      had been a motive in his generosity; and if so, it certainly behoved him
      to find it out, and that as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was surprised, but that emotion gave way to one of affright when she
      beheld her father&rsquo;s pale and haggard face, his closed eyes, and his lips
      apart. It looked like the approach of death. She knew what a shock the
      arrival of Jukes had given him. Shattered as his frame had been by
      affliction, it had been yet more deeply shaken by the mortal agony he had
      endured when he first learned the destruction of the residence he had
      quitted by fire, when his darling child barely escaped with life. Events
      calculated to act upon his nervous system had rapidly followed each other;
      and the last, by its sudden effect upon him, seemed in no degree the least
      severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she hung over him, mournful and foreboding words fell from her lips.
      She turned her eyes appealingly for aid to Hal, for of those present he
      was the only one to whom she could address herself, in reliance upon the
      sincerity of his readiness to assist her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Mires observed her glance, and at whom it was directed. Before
      Hal, nimble though he was in responding to her mute summons, could reach
      her, Colonel Mires placed himself at the side of her father, laid his
      fingers upon his wrist, and said, in a low but musical tone of voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not alarmed, Miss Wilton. A sudden faintness only has seized your
      father. When last we met, his position was very far above this, and on
      meeting with me no doubt the fearful reverse he has experienced has acted
      upon his weak frame. Pray cease to fear&mdash;I believe that I can
      speedily restore him; and, when he is a little collected and composed, we
      will design measures to remove him from this charnel-house of the
      unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora turned her eyes with a grateful expression upon him, but became
      instantly embarrassed by his steadfast gaze, while a creeping sensation of
      fear and dislike passed over her head. She glanced at Hal, and was rather
      startled to find him regarding the Colonel with a very fierce expression.
      Why, she did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had yet to learn that a lover rarely betrays satisfaction when he
      perceives the gaze of one of his own sex dwelling with marked admiration
      upon the fair features of the maid he loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the Colonel observed the fiery look of the young goldsmith; if he
      did, he outwardly took no notice of it; but taking from his breast pocket
      a small case, which contained a phial, he poured a few drops into some
      water, and administered it to old Wilton, who had no sooner taken it than
      he revived, and became speedily conscious of the presence of his visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dark features of the Colonel attracted his attention, he clutched
      his daughter&rsquo;s hand, and, in a hoarse whisper, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it safe&mdash;is it safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what safe, dear father?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paper!&mdash;the paper I gave into your care,&rdquo; he replied, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; she responded, quickly. &ldquo;I gave it back to you, scarce half an
      hour ago. Do you not remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed his hand to his brow, and then pressed his fingers over his
      eyes, as if to recal what had recently passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the restorative administered to him by the colonel was
      quickly apparent. He withdrew his hand, and gazed about him, but only for
      a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose up: his eye was bright, his carriage firm, and his head erect. His
      bearing gave him the aspect of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Mires,&rdquo; he exclaimed in a tone of exultation, &ldquo;your arrival in
      England, at this juncture, is most opportune&mdash;your discovery of me,
      in this prison, an interposition of Providence. Its consequences to me are
      of vital importance, and it is impossible to describe the joy, the
      happiness, it has brought to a man bowed down by a succession of dire
      misfortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilton, I am unprepared to hear such expressions from your lips;
      believe me, it affords me especial gratification,&rdquo; rejoined Colonel Mires,
      casting his eyes craftily upon Flora, to observe what effect her father&rsquo;s
      words, in his praise, would have upon her. But she saw not his glance, for
      she was watching anxiously the features, of Hal Vivian, who was listening
      to her father with a countenance which appeared to assume a deeper gravity
      at every succeeding sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she wondered that he should grow so serious, and seem so sad, because
      her father spoke in tones of joyfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she known that he considered her father&rsquo;s favour a passport to her
      own, she might not have marvelled at his sober countenance at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton proceeded, addressing the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hackneyed aphorism which tells us that &lsquo;the darkest hour is the hour
      before the dawn,&rsquo; is true in my case, Colonel Mires. My dark hour has
      spent the whole force of its pestilential blackness upon me. I have been
      utterly shrouded in its gloom. Your coming is as the dawn which will
      herald my day of sunshine. How wondrous are the workings of Providence!
      But now I was <i>in extremis</i>; lo! in an instant I bound into new life,
      and yet in the same old&mdash;old world. Oh! Colonel Mires, my heart is
      too full for utterance. I will take another and a better opportunity to
      express, not alone what I feel, but to explain to you wherefore your
      arrival has filled me with delight, and why it will prove to me a benefit
      so inestimable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour, Mr. Wilton, by so doing you will confer a great favour
      upon me,&rdquo; returned Colonel Mires, &ldquo;for at present, I do assure you, your
      expression of high satisfaction, and your excited manner, form together a
      problem which I feel quite incapable of working to a successful solution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be more than surprised if such were not the case,&rdquo; returned old
      Wilton quickly. &ldquo;How could you understand my gladness at beholding you,
      when the only conclusion you could form from the past would be, that I
      should meet you with combined feelings of regret and reproach. It is not
      possible for you to conjecture how your advent should be productive of
      happiness to me and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my coming to England&mdash;even though I know not how&mdash;should be
      the occasion of so agreeable a change in the lot of Miss Wilton, I shall
      only be too delighted at my good fortune, without caring to inquire by
      what happy combination of circumstances it has been effected!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Colonel Mires, with another very steadfast, earnest glance at Flora, which
      embarrassed her, and did not have the desired effect of making her think
      favourably of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude, Colonel Mires,&rdquo; exclaimed Wilton, drily, &ldquo;would, I have no
      doubt, raise up such a feeling in your breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel winced, but bowed affirmatively. Wilton then added, hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Mires, your discovery of my detention in this prison is, of
      course, entirely the result of accident. You did not come here to see me&mdash;of
      that I am aware&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment I had a suspicion&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton waved his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite able to comprehend the reason of your presence, Colonel,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;but I am not, to sustain a longer interview to day. You will do me
      a favour by excusing me now, but if you will oblige me with your address,
      I will call upon you there at any appointment you may make, and take an
      occasion to explain to you much of the present mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry Vivian had previously entertained some doubts about the saneness of
      old Wilton. The strange rebound from abject wretchedness to a species of
      delirious joy, startled him. <i>He</i> could see nothing in the exterior
      of the swarthy colonel from India, to raise up such a paroxysm of
      gratification as that displayed by the careworn old man, unless he
      expected him to pay off the detainers at the prison gate, and thus set him
      free. But when old Wilton requested of Colonel Mires his address, and
      offered to call upon him at <i>any</i> time he might appoint, then Hal&rsquo;s
      doubts were dissipated. What! with two thousand pounds turned into locks,
      bolts, bars, and iron gates, to arrest his movements, to talk of keeping
      appointments outside the prison-gates! Why it was the very phantasy of
      lunacy. He believed him to be without a farthing in the world, and had
      provided himself with a little sum with which to carry the old man on, if
      he would accept it, and there was previously every probability that he
      would; but now, to hear his tone, and to note his manner, as well as to
      listen to his airy offer to appear anywhere at any time, he felt disposed
      to button his pocket, and to laugh. He did not do either&mdash;he
      whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a soft, low sound, unconsciously emitted, not altogether well bred
      we must admit, but it was the very symbol of extreme surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton heard him, glanced at him, turned his eyes away, and a faint
      smile curled his upper lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora heard the whistle too, she looked at Hal, and then at her father.
      She had her misgivings likewise&mdash;she believed every shilling he had
      possessed to be gone, and to hear him speak thus made her heart throb
      violently. Oh, if grief and trial should have turned his brain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father understood her gaze, he read her thoughts, and his smile
      deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Mires heard the unconscious whistle, also. He darted a look at
      Hal, and then turned to Wilton, and peering at him under his eyebrows in a
      scrutinising manner, he said, in a tone which had more than a tinge of
      irony in it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say to-morrow, Mr. Wilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; thought Hal, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it; he might as well say
      half-an-hour hence&mdash;one is as likely as the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise, not less than to that of Colonel Mires, Wilton answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, if you please. At what hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At moonshine,&rdquo; thought Hal; &ldquo;poor old man, how mad he is getting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning,&rdquo; returned the Colonel, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At ten!&rdquo; echoed Wilton; &ldquo;you have not named the place,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be here, if there is to be a meeting anywhere,&rdquo; thought Hal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Mires produced a card-case, and handed a card to Wilton, who held
      it close to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he muttered, and then exclaimed aloud&mdash;&ldquo;I will be there,
      Colonel, punctually, and without fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not put you to any inconvenience, I hope?&rdquo; said Colonel Mires,
      with a mystified air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, oh no!&rdquo; returned old Wilton, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure not,&rdquo; reflected Hal, &ldquo;how should it? there is only two
      thousand pounds to prevent him leaving the prison, and what is that to a
      man who has not two crowns to jingle together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Mires gave a dry cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it was an easy thing to effect a
      liberation from this place. I have an old friend in durance here, whom I
      came to see; he has been here a length of time, and is in tribulation at
      the remote possibility of his deliverance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is not difficult when you know the way. I have a way,&rdquo; returned
      Wilton, rather curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And two thousand pounds, too, of course,&rdquo; mentally suggested Hal,
      considering it hard to understand why, under such circumstances, Wilton
      should have suffered himself to be imprisoned at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep my appointment, Colonel Mires, never fear,&rdquo; said Wilton
      decidedly, though coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave here, possibly, to-day,&rdquo; suggested the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall accompany my daughter hence,&rdquo; responded Wilton
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal walked to the window and looked out: this last remark by Wilton seemed
      to him quite to settle the point of his sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old gentleman! his brain is completely turned. Poor Flora! fresh
      troubles, instead of coming happiness for you,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Well, I will
      try everything to make your heavy burden of care sit as lightly upon your
      shoulders as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let me repeat, Colonel,&rdquo; remarked old Wilton, with emphasis, &ldquo;I
      shall be glad if by taking your leave you will close this interview. I am
      fatigued&mdash;overcome by the exciting events of the past few days; I
      wish to be alone with my daughter and Mr. Vivian, as noble and gallant a
      gentleman as England ever produced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated the Colonel, in a tone of insulting surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact, nevertheless,&rdquo; continued Wilton, and raising his voice, said, &ldquo;many
      a would-be Bayard, <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>, would have hesitated
      ere he attempted to perform the brave deed this gallant youth has lately
      achieved. You will know more of him anon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was strange how steadfastly the two men looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes
      as Wilton uttered these words. Colonel Mires was a soldier, a martinet, he
      had been able to look down his inferior officers and his men, by the hard
      fixedness of his gaze; but he could not compel Hal to wink an eyelash. The
      clear bright eye of the youth was not to be made to waver, and the Colonel
      found himself obliged to be the first to remove his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he can never be the suitor for the hand of Wilton&rsquo;s
      daughter. If he is, he shall never have her. By heaven! so lovely a
      creature shall never be thrown away upon such a churl as he. A pearl for
      such a pig! Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, with much discomfort, forced to leave the pearl with the
      pig, and obliged to see that while Flora would not permit her eyes to meet
      his, she frequently suffered them, radiant with lustrous beauty, to settle
      upon Hal&rsquo;s face, lingering there as though loth to leave what they loved
      to dwell upon. It was not an agreeable reflection, considering the new
      emotions awakened in his breast by the sight of her face. It may have been
      that dormant passion only was aroused; he chose to consider it a new
      sensation, and determined to satiate it at any cost or hazard. He was,
      however, not a man to suffer himself to appear to be disconcerted; he was
      cool and calculating, and was not defeated until the possibility of
      victory was wholly removed, then he accepted the condition with inward
      mortification, perhaps, and a hope to obtain the alternative of revenge,
      but he did not suffer to appear whatured (sp.). Rage and disappointment he
      felt acutely, but no one ever saw him exhibit either.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his leave of Flora with that gentlemanly respect that betokens
      good breeding&mdash;of Hal, with a formal bow, which said plainly, though
      not rudely: &ldquo;You may be a Chevalier Bayard, disguised as a civilian, but I
      am not ambitious of making your acquaintance.&rdquo; He shook Wilton heartily by
      the hand, as if he were sincere at least in that performance, and
      expressing his gratification at the prospect of meeting him early on the
      following morning, he took his departure, bearing with him his friend, who
      had been all eyes and ears but of no speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Wilton, by gazing from the window, had satisfied himself that Colonel
      Mires had mingled with the throng below, he returned to the centre of the
      room, and, folding his daughter to his heart, he kissed her forehead, and
      said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own sweet darling Flo&rsquo;, cease to regard me with such anxious eyes. I
      am not mad!&mdash;in very truth my child, I am not. My sorrows have sorely
      tried me, but heaven has been withal kind, and has spared me my reason.
      You do not know the source of my present joy, as you know not the occasion
      of my fall from a position, the pleasures and luxuries of which you were
      too young to appreciate, and which were snatched from you ere you were old
      enough to regret or comprehend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, dear father, whenever I see a handsome mansion, filled with
      splendid furniture, magnificent pictures, beautiful sculpture, standing in
      the midst of gay parterres, over which wave graceful trees, I seem to go
      back to a time when I lived in such scenes. I have fancied that I have
      dreamed of these lovely places in childhood; and when I have in later days
      come to see them, I have believed that my dreams only have recurred to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No dreams, my Flo&rsquo;, but a real mansion, with its luxurious apartments,
      its galleries of pictures, sculptures, and articles of <i>vertu</i> rare
      and costly, its terraced gardens, its stately trees, its glassy streams
      and lakes, its tall fountains, and its gorgeous woodlands. No dream, my
      Flo&rsquo;; for in such a scene you were born. In such a scene you shall reign,
      queen of beauty, ere you are much older. My Flo&rsquo;, no dream, but reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clutched her by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dream has been from the hour when that splendour, at one remorseless,
      dreadful swoop, was torn from my grasp up to the moment of Mires&rsquo;
      appearance here to-day. That fearful interval has been the dark, horrible,
      terrible dream; but, my Flo&rsquo;, the shadows of the night are passing from
      us, the fragrance of the morning air is in my nostrils, the golden dawn
      has begun to light up our too long darkened hemisphere, and we shall yet
      revel in the refulgent beams of an unclouded sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her again and again to his bosom, and kissed her with
      passionate fondness, while large tears rolled down his yet pallid cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      While yet caressing her, and as Hal was preparing to ask him to give him
      some proof that what he had just previously asserted was no mere
      hallucination, a faint knock was heard at the room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Wilton could clear his voice to give the permission to enter the
      room, the door opened and closed instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But rapid as was the action, the door on closing had left within the room
      Nathan Gomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded at Wilton, he nodded at Hal, and he smiled&mdash;that is,
      grinned&mdash;at Flora. All the while his face glowed like burnished gold
      upon which a sunbeam rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilton uttered a cry of joy. He ran up to him, and seized him by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see you,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagined as much. Here I am,&rdquo; responded Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wilton cast his eyes rapidly upon Flora, upon Hal, and then on Nathan
      Gomer. For an instant he appeared perplexed, then he said to Hal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora has not seen the wonders of this place, Master Henry Vivian. Will
      you conduct her where she can see how the prisoners pass away their long
      and wearisome days of confinement? Just for a stroll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal could have told him that she had already witnessed as much as it was
      necessary for her to see, but he guessed that Wilton desired to be alone
      with Nathan Gomer, and he bowed assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no objection, Master Vivian,&rdquo; observed Wilton, fancying that he
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Objection!&rdquo; echoed Hal, with an astounded look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objection! What, to have Flora to himself for ten minutes or a quarter of
      an hour? unquestionably not. He emphatically expressed himself to that
      effect, and so Flora tied on her sweet little bonnet, and put on her neat
      little mantle, and laid the softest of soft hands upon his arm, making it
      thrill to his heart, near to which it rested, until he hardly remembered
      anything but that she was at his side&mdash;at once the richest, dearest
      treasure upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused by the noise, and by the jostling of the throng of persons in the
      racket ground, they unconsciously strolled round to the back of the
      prison, or to the county side, as it is termed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the hours of ten and three, this part was comparatively deserted.
      At the period of which we are writing, the needy prisoners, who lived on
      the support of their creditors and the county, were alone permitted to mix
      on the parade in front, or to visit their fellow prisoners who were better
      off than themselves, during that part of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      No county prisoner&mdash;for they had their prison pride&mdash;liked to be
      looked upon as a &ldquo;county bird,&rdquo; so he showed himself in front as long as
      he could. The back part, thus, as we have said, had few persons
      promenading its precincts at the hours named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora and Hal were, in consequence, comparatively alone in their walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they strolled on, both seemed full of thought; after a silence, which
      endured for a short time, a few remarks were made, but of no personal
      nature; at length Hal ventured to say to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible, my dear Miss Wilton, that your father is not
      labouring under a delusion in speaking of his immediate liberation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Flora had expected this question, yet she had not prepared an
      answer to it. She paused for a moment, then replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the moment my dear father was seized as a prisoner, until now, the
      whole affair has been inexplicable to me. I believe you know even more of
      his affairs than I do. What can I answer? the matter of his conversation
      seems to me to be visionary, yet I never remember him to be so clear in
      his delivery, nor so elated, without being incoherent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may only be a sign of the disease which may have fastened itself
      upon him, following the terrible agony of grief he has had to endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Vivian, in mercy do not say so&mdash;pray do not! I do not think
      he is deranged&mdash;do you not remember that when he said to me he was
      not mad, how coherently he spoke? I entreat you, Mr. Vivian, not to say
      you think his mind is gone; if you do, I shall believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hal saw the tears spring into her eyes, and he blamed himself for having
      brought them there, especially when she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will so much add to the grief I have already suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not add to it for the world, Miss Wilton,&rdquo; he said hastily, and
      added thoughtfully, &ldquo;it may have been selfishness which has led me to form
      the supposition, but I would willingly, though not cheerfully, abandon it
      if I thought, by so doing, you would be spared one painful emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not cheerfully,&rdquo; said Flora with innocent surprise, &ldquo;why with reluctance,
      Mr. Vivian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not reluctance, Miss Wilton, that is not the word&mdash;sorrow is the
      truer term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you; I am, I suppose, very dull; but, Mr. Vivian, is
      it possible that you could be sorry to find my father not insane?&rdquo; she
      inquired, with some earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;if what your father has said be not the wanderings of
      a disturbed mind, the return of the gentleman who has recently visited
      him, from India, has opened up to him an immediate return to some former
      wealthy position, even though the instrument appears as unconscious of his
      power to effect it as we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I understand it,&rdquo; returned Flora, finding Hal pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he exclaimed, strong feeling being manifest in the tone of his
      voice, &ldquo;I should not, I trust you will credit me, be sorry that he had
      achieved his immediate release from this filthy prison, or that he and you&mdash;you,
      Miss Wilton, were restored to a position you so eminently deserve to
      occupy; but I should, I fear, grieve to think that all your good could not
      be accomplished without my discomfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your discomfort?&rdquo; asked Flora, catching his arm, and looking into his
      eyes with an expression of interest for which he would have willingly
      pressed her to his heart if he dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little confused, for he saw plain enough that if he had no heart
      to pain her, she had no desire to occasion him discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Wilton,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to speak honestly to you&mdash;I had
      reared up a little fabric, based upon what I thought to be your condition;
      I had expected from it much happiness, perhaps that of securing to you
      immunity from troubles and trials, so far as I could. By the return of
      this Indian officer, it is dashed to the ground, and shattered to atoms. I
      rejoice most sincerely that it has brought you and your father good, but
      do not think harshly of me if I selfishly regret that by it my prospects
      of felicity are swept away entirely In the time to come, when difference
      of position shall part us for ever, may I ask you, Flora&mdash;Miss Wilton&mdash;to
      believe that, had the opportunity been afforded me, I would, when tried,
      have proved to you a sincere and a true friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the time to come&mdash;when we shall part for ever&mdash;what
      difference of station should part us? Oh, Mr. Vivian, I could not&mdash;I
      would not, accept a position which might bring such an estrangement to
      pass. I would sooner die&mdash;I owe&mdash;my life&mdash;to your bravery.&rdquo;
       She seized his hand and kissed it, and then burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal was almost in the act of placing his arm about her, and giving vent to
      a passionate declaration, when a hand was placed upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round with a sudden start, which almost upset the individual who
      had touched him. He found it to be Nathan Gomer, who grinned, and,
      pointing with his thumb behind him, said to Flora&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father awaits you both in his room. He is about to quit the prison
      with you, but he wishes to say a few words to you before he departs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the two thousand pounds for which he is lodged here?&rdquo; said Hal, with
      a stupified air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid, sir&mdash;all paid, sir! Mr. Wilton is free to leave here when he
      will, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Nathan Gomer, with the old grin upon his features.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>elen Grahame sat
      in her dressing-room alone. Scarce half-an-hour had elapsed since she had
      quitted the side of Lester Vane, after their stroll in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her handkerchief, which she had dropped during her interview with Hugh
      Riversdale in the thicket, yet glared before her eyes as it had done when
      presented by him who, with a sharp, penetrating gaze, had sought to
      extract evidence out of her confusion to assure him that she was the
      heroine of the stolen interview he had disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She yet saw it floating and whirling among the circling eddies of the
      meandering waters, which ran past her feet, and drew such small
      consolation from the possibility of its never being again recovered&mdash;at
      least to her disadvantage&mdash;as it might afford her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something to have destroyed the only evidence that could identify
      her with that stolen meeting, which had been the cause of so much
      mystification, excitement, and scandal among the household. She could
      scarcely prevent a proud smile of triumph curling her small upper lip when
      she reflected that the mastery she possessed over the play of her
      features, when she brought her will into action, had enabled her to baffle
      the scrutiny of Vane, which she felt instinctively was exerted to enable
      him to obtain power over her. Her womanly instincts were too acute, too
      keen, for her not to comprehend that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true she had no notion that he intended to act basely or falsely to
      her. In spite of his display, his assumption of wealth, and the inferences
      he left to be drawn from his suggestions, she entertained a conviction
      that his sources of income were far more limited in capacity than he
      wished them to appear. Her father&rsquo;s reputed affluence&mdash;of the reality
      of which she in common with the other members of the family, had no doubt&mdash;she
      could easily understand, would attract the attention of a young man of
      high family, who had but little with which to support his station, and she
      as readily comprehended that he would do his best to secure the hand of
      the eldest daughter of a man of wealth, if with it he ensured also the
      certainty of a handsome settlement, to say nothing of the unquestionable
      charms of the &ldquo;encumbrance&rdquo; he would have to take with the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been twenty-four hours in his company before she detected that
      he had determined upon becoming a suitor for her hand, having fortified
      himself with a belief that her father would give with her a dower, which
      would for ever set at rest his pecuniary anxieties for the future. But she
      revolted at the thought of being sought for what she should bring, rather
      than for her beauty&mdash;her heart, so brimful of passion and tenderness&mdash;for
      her very self. Especially did she recoil from the supposition that she was
      a &ldquo;tassel gentle&rdquo; to be lured by such a falconer&rsquo;s voice, for the purpose
      of his own aggrandisement, and her whole soul rose in rebellion against
      being made the puppet in such a scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Lester Vane was well-formed and handsome. There were certain
      points in his figure and in his lineaments of a character to attract and
      to win the admiration of many women&mdash;those, at least, who, with the
      failing of their sex, are led by appearances. He had a musically-toned
      voice, and a tongue, gifted with the soft cunning of oily phrases, in so
      eminent a degree, that it could be scarcely surpassed by that which our
      mother Eve found herself unequal to resist. There were few women, who, if
      heart-free, would have been likely to resist his advances, or to have
      remained proof against them were he to address himself to them as a lover.
      Hitherto, he had not found female conquest difficult; there was a
      peculiarity in his manner and appearance which interested a woman in his
      favour immediately she beheld him; and thus, having mastered the
      approaches, he, where he listed, found the citadel not difficult to carry
      by a <i>coup de main</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was conscious of all this. She had read his character intuitively,
      and had formed a just estimate of him. Perhaps her predominant feeling
      towards him was contempt; but with that was mingled a strange dread of
      some power he possessed to injure her, and which, at a future period, he
      would exercise with a merciless malignity. She knew this impression had no
      foundation, in fact&mdash;was, in truth, a mere in defined sense of
      impending evil, of which he was to be the perpetrator, she the sufferer.
      Yet, true to the nature of her sex, her conclusion, arrived at by no
      process of reasoning, was as clear and determined as though it had been
      based upon a train of facts which admitted neither of doubt nor dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;Hugh can have nothing to fear from him, even
      though he will, I am fully convinced, omit no stratagem to gain my love,
      as the means of securing my hand and portion&mdash;the portion being
      rather a considerable item in the object he proposes to accomplish. His
      eye looks down searchingly into my heart, as though he would read and
      interpret its most delicate mysteries and fathom its secrets, that he may
      hold me in duress. Never! I defy him! He cannot, shall not, detect or
      decipher anything I may purpose to conceal. He has destined me for his
      prey, a golden fly, to be enmeshed in the entanglements of a web, every
      filament of which is too palpable in my eyes. Ha! there are two words to a
      bargain. It would be a delicious revenge to bring this schemer down upon
      his knees before me, actually and absolutely an abject wooer: so that
      when, with burning words and scorching tears, he pleaded his love, I might
      spurn him with my foot. I will do it! Already has he commenced, with
      consummate art, to make me think about him: he must exercise a wily skill
      indeed to make me love him! I will meet him upon his own battle-field; I
      will not appear to employ either art or skill, yet will I stake my
      happiness that I will compel him to love me with a passionate ardour, of
      which now he does not believe his soul capable. Ay, and when, with a
      whirlwind of pleadings, urgings, and fervid prayers, he implores me to
      bestow my heart upon him, then, in my moment of triumph, I will open up to
      his terrible discomfiture my full knowledge of the speculation which
      embraced my purse with my person, and laugh with derisive scorn, at so
      shallow an attempt to win and wear me&mdash;<i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While that reference to herself yet trembled upon her lips, a thought
      rushed through her brain, and a flush of crimson spread itself over her
      fair neck and face, and then it subsided, and left her deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the postman&rsquo;s well-known ring at the gate-bell, given with
      skilful force, resounded suddenly through the house. The noise made her
      start, and utter a faint scream. Her heart began to beat violently, while
      a strange presentiment seized her that the epistle which had arrived by
      this channel was for her. An emotion of dread oppressed her, for which she
      was at a loss to account, for she had but few correspondents, and among
      them there was not one whose communication ought to contain any matter to
      occasion her feelings of dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had forgotten one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened breathlessly for the light foot-fall of Chayter. She was not
      disappointed. The door opened, and her quiet, neatly-dressed, sleek maid
      entered, bearing a note upon a small silver salver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen assumed an air of indifference she did not feel. She glanced, from
      beneath her long dark eyelashes, rapidly at the letter, but she played
      with the pendants of a bracelet, and yawned in Chayter&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter for you, if you please, miss,&rdquo; said the girl, and handed it to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it down, Chayter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will read it by and by. I am in no
      humour now to bore over a long crossed scrawl from a tiresome school
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laid the letter upon the small table at Helen&rsquo;s elbow, remarking
      to herself, as she gazed upon the superscription, that the school friend
      wrote a remark ably vigorous, masculine hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is papa?&rdquo; inquired Helen, with seeming apathy, although deeply
      interested in the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the library, if you please, miss,&rdquo; the girl answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mamma, and the rest of them,&rdquo; added Helen. &ldquo;Your mamma, and his
      Grace, and Miss Margaret, and Mr. Malcolm, are walking in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Honorable Mr. Lester Vane and Miss Evangeline are in the
      drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the drawing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss, quite alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt surprised and annoyed to hear this. She did not stay to inquire
      why. Upon the first blush, it seemed to her that Lester Vane had no right
      to be alone with her sister. She was irritated and vexed; not, as she
      suggested to herself, that she cared, because she had a contempt for the
      man; but then, to preserve merely the harmony of consistency, he ought to
      be alone with no one else but her, and look into no other eyes than her
      own. Evangeline, too, so reserved&mdash;so shy. She shook her head.
      Perhaps there was more art and depth in that apparently timid girl than
      any of them had ever dreamed of. She determined, instantly, to observe her
      more closely. Evangeline hitherto had passed as a stupid, harmless,
      nervous child, yet beneath such an exterior might lurk much shrewd
      sagacity, and a power to think and act for herself for which she had not
      previously received credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen rather prided herself upon her own perceptive faculties, and, like
      many of her sex, she was so exceedingly keen-sighted as to be at times
      precipitated into forming erroneous conclusions. It occurred to her that
      it would not be altogether impolitic to put in an appearance, rather
      unexpectedly, in the drawingroom, where Vane was <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
      her sister. A glance at the faces of both, she assured herself, would
      suffice to tell her what course Vane was pursuing, and it would serve to
      direct her future conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose with this intention, and, as she moved past her little table, her
      eye fell upon the letter which the sudden communication by Chayter,
      respecting her sister and Lester Vane, had caused her to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes hastily around the apartment, Chayter was no longer
      there. She was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took up the letter and held it to the lamp, so that she might see the
      superscription clearly. She started as she recognised the handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven! I thought so,&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;It is from Hugh. How thoughtless
      to address to me here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She examined the post-mark, which bore the name of Southampton. She drew a
      long breath, as though to nerve herself to meet the contents of the
      letter, which she felt would have a marked influence upon her future
      destiny, and then she broke the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents were penned by a hurried and trembling hand; the very
      character of the scrawled letters betrayed the workings of a mind
      convulsed by passion and sorrow&mdash;the words themselves only too
      emphatically proved what the ill-formed characters suggested. She read,
      with burning eyes, what follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Helen! thou passionately loved! Measure the intensity of my grief when
      you learn that my dread forebodings are verified. I sail by the &lsquo;Ripon&rsquo; to
      India on the 4th, three days hence. My agony is insupportable! To be
      parted from you for years&mdash;perhaps never more to meet on earth&mdash;drives
      me to despair&mdash;distraction! I could refuse to quit England. I did. An
      alternative was presented to me; it involved the desolation of one to
      insure whose happiness my life were too mean a gift; it would have hurled
      me into beggary, and would still have sundered me from you&mdash;from you,
      Helen, you my life-spring, the font from whence I draw the only joy this
      world can yield me. What could I do? The chained and manacled slave had
      more freedom of action than I! My choice lay between this loathed voyage
      and comparative annihilation, and my consent to leave England has been
      thus wrung from me. Helen, though but these feeble words greet your tender
      eyes, yet I am with you face to face, near, near to you in spirit.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold thrill ran through the frame of Helen as she read these words, and
      she raised her eyes, shrinking and gazing into the misty space before her,
      as if expecting to see his form, phantom-like and grim, standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she saw only the pictures on the walls and the hanging draperies, so,
      with a cold tremor, she went on with the perusal of the letter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You remember, Helen, that night when we stood together in the abbey
      ruins alone&mdash;the cold, grey moonlight streamed through the oriel
      window&mdash;shattered and decayed it was&mdash;and rested upon a
      mutilated cross. You remember that cross, Helen, as, silver like, it stood
      out in bold relief? My earnest gaze was upon it, Helen, when my fevered,
      trembling lips uttered words in your ear only too feeble and inexpressive
      to convey the depth and intensity of that love, which your gentle
      tenderness and your unsurpassed beauty had won from me. And by that cross
      I swore to be true to you while I had life. I see that cross now, Helen!
      Can you? I repeat the oath I took on that night. Will you, oh, Helen,
      dearest? You do not forget that, while my vow was yet vibrating in your
      ear, you turned your lustrous eyes upon that glowing emblem of mortal
      redemption. Your sweet head reclined upon my heaving breast, and in
      faltering words, you owned that the passion was not unrequited&mdash;that
      you loved me. Your warm, fragrant breath played upon my cheeks as you
      pointed to that cross, and called Heaven to witness to your truth&mdash;to
      testify that, in the time to come, your affection should be as unchanging
      and as unchangeable as my own. Look, Helen, there! See you not that cross
      standing sharply and brightly out from the shadows beyond? Will you refuse
      the duty it calls upon you to perform, or forget the oath it commands you
      to remember? Out of my deep love for you, at what sacrifice would I pause?
      What hesitate to do and dare, that you might be mine? Ah, Helen, will you
      be mine, as you have so often fondly sworn you were, and would be ever?
      Are you prepared for the test which shall prove it? It is this. Will you,
      on receipt of this letter, join me here? Will you, Helen? I have made
      every arrangement by which you can travel on the 3rd by the four o&rsquo;clock
      train to Southampton alone and secure from interruption. On your arrival,
      you will be received by a lady, who will be expecting you, and will
      conduct you to apartments prepared for you. On the 4th, we will be united
      by </i>a legal<i> marriage, as we have been by love, and&mdash;nay, we
      will then bid farewell to England, with hearts light and free; for, come
      any evil after it, we shall at least be happy in the possession of each
      other, and can no more be parted, but by death. Helen, my own Helen, if
      you will fly to me, the devotion of a life will be too poor a return for
      the integrity, the purity, the magnanimity of your love. If you come not&mdash;well,
      words would be idle. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh Riversdale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen staggered to her chair as she concluded the epistle. She pressed her
      hands to her throbbing temples; her brain was in a whirl; she had not the
      power for a minute or two to summon a single thought to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that night! Ay! the events crowded into it were not likely to be
      forgotten by her. As her hot palms pressed down her eyelids, she saw as in
      a vision the ruined abbey, desolate and silent, in the broad moon-light,
      the moss-grown, ivy-bound walls, the dilapidated aisles, the triple-arched
      windows, mouldering and falling away, very skeletons of what they had once
      been; the rude masses of masonry half buried in the long, rank grass; but,
      above all, that cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      That cross!
    </p>
    <p>
      It now glittered and sparkled and wreathed before her eyes as if it were
      living flame, and darted out long, forked, arrowy tongues, to blister and
      consume her if she violated her oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet with a scream and a shudder of horror. She gazed
      affrightedly round her; the sight of her maid, Chayter, who had, with
      noiseless step, reentered the room, however, dispelled the vision, and
      restored her to something like composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked for her letter; it was open upon the table where it had fallen;
      waving her hand, she said, in a voice hoarse with emotion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me, Chayter; I will ring when I require your services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl glanced at the letter and then at her mistress. She gave a short
      cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is growing late, miss!&rdquo; she said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo; almost shrieked the haughty beauty, stamping her foot
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl dropped a hurried curtsey, and slunk swiftly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been witness to small displays of irritability, but never to such
      an ebullition of temper as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When alone, Helen strode to the door and locked it. She threw herself into
      her chair, and again pressed her beating temples with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he mad?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Fly with him and to India! How selfish&mdash;how
      unreasonable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked for a sacrifice as the test of her love; but what a sacrifice!
      She loved him&mdash;he ought to know that. What had she not done to give
      him proofs of it? If the proofs he had already received were insufficient,
      what could suffice? Not even the very sacrifice he called upon her to
      make. He had spoken of sacrifices, he had reminded her of their mutual
      vow, but now he sought to make her crown those cumulative sacrifices by
      inducing her to fling away all personal considerations, and follow his
      fortunes&mdash;to minister to his happiness by the surrender of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she doubted she should be happy in becoming his wife, but then
      there was so much that went to make up the sum of perfect contentment,
      which she must forego upon quitting home, and which she could not hope to
      possess or enjoy after she had linked her fate with his. Trifles are they
      at best, but to have pleasure the rule, and retirement the exception to be
      flattered, admired, the cynosure of adoring eyes&mdash;are constituent
      parts of many a woman&rsquo;s happiness, wanting only the love of one to make a
      perfect felicity. Helen was called upon to make her election. She could
      not, it appeared, have done both. If she flung away the pleasures of the
      world and the comforts of wealth, she would have to be compensated by
      Hugh&rsquo;s passionate love and entire devotion. If she flung away his love&mdash;well,
      there was still her luxurious home, and&mdash;and if he was bent upon
      being so very, very obstinate in his selfish demands, and in the event of
      her not taking part in his wild scheme, were to sunder the connection
      between them&mdash;well, there were others moving in a higher sphere than
      his, who would kneel at her feet, and give to her entire and undisputed
      sway, so that she but bestowed her hand upon the suppliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to him,&rdquo; she said, taking up his letter, and placing it in
      her desk, which she carefully locked. &ldquo;Yes, I will write to him, and show
      to him the weakness and the folly of what he asks. Papa would be frenzied,
      and mamma would surely die of mortified pride if I were to take such a
      step. No, no; it must not be. You were not in your senses, Hugh, when you
      addressed that letter to me, and so thoughtless, too, to direct it here.
      Poor fellow!&mdash;poor dear fellow!&mdash;how he loves me!&mdash;how
      deeply, dearly, he truly loves me!&mdash;dear Hugh!&mdash;yes, I well
      remember that night of mutual confession&mdash;oh! I well remember the
      tumult of joy which swelled my bosom when your trembling voice, and nearly
      inarticulate words, told me that which I already instinctively knew, but
      which I so longed for you to confess, my dear, dear Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To what result the train of reflection, now taking an opposite path to
      that which at first it pursued, might have led, we do not pretend to say.
      Helen was here interrupted by a knock at the door, followed by the voice
      of Chayter, who informed her young mistress that she was expected in the
      drawing-room, inquiries having been already made for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a rapid glance at her face in the glass. It was pale as
      alabaster, but there was no further trace of the disorder her mind had
      suffered; and so assuming a calm demeanour, she admitted Chayter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe I have been dozing,&rdquo; she said to the sleek girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything of the kind,&rdquo; thought Chayter; but, smiling,
      said&mdash;&ldquo;Dear me, miss, what a thing it is to be lovely, and have a
      dozen noble and beautiful gentlemen grieving to death for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chayter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, miss! it is as I say,&rdquo; continued the girl. &ldquo;I can see. There is his
      Grace talking of nothing but you, and the Honorable Mr. Vane hoping that
      you are not ill because you keep your own room, and you all the while so
      indifferent, dozing in your chair, and Miss Margaret looking&mdash;I beg
      your pardon, miss&mdash;as if she would give her ears to be taken notice
      of by either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress me, Chayter!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, abruptly, &ldquo;and, if you can, pray be
      silent; your volubility makes my head ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chayter understood a hint, though she did not quite comprehend whether
      volubility meant impertinence or overwhelming information. She gathered
      from Helen&rsquo;s tone that she was in no humour to listen to her prattle, and
      she was shrewd enough to keep her tongue still when its rattle was likely
      to be unwelcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen quickly made her toilet, and had seldom looked more beautiful than
      she did when she entered the drawing-room, which, though half filled by
      the guests and family, was all but silent without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eye ran round the apartment as she glided in, and she perceived her
      mamma and sister Margaret conversing together. Her papa was discoursing
      with the young Duke upon the management of estates, and detailing a plan
      by which to obtain the largest possible amount of income with the least
      possible expenditure, to all of which the Duke appeared to listen, though
      he yawned frequently; but he rescued himself from the charge of
      inattention by occasionally observing&mdash;&ldquo;Weally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pwecisely,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pwobably,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wemawkable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malcolm was half-asleep upon a couch, and Lester Vane was seated by the
      side of her sister Evangeline, talking with her in a tone sufficiently low
      as not to be heard&mdash;at least, where she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      What strange feeling was it that possessed her when her eye fell upon
      Evangeline and Lester Vane, as it were <i>tête-à-tête</i>? Why did a flush
      mount to her brow, and a pang of vexation shoot through her breast? He was
      nothing to her; what he might do ought to have no interest in her eyes,
      for if any feeling for him was predominant in her heart, it was not
      certainly of a favourable nature. Yet he had gazed upon her so ardently,
      and spoken to her with such gentle tones, that if she could draw a
      conclusion from his manner, it was that her beauty had made a deep
      impression upon his heart. Now to see his dreamy eyes dwelling on
      Evangeline&rsquo;s innocent face so earnestly, to observe his impressive manner,
      as he addressed her with words toned so as to make her gentle heart thrill
      with a new emotion, was to be made to feel that she had made no impression
      upon him at all, or that he made love to her simply <i>pour passer le
      temps</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burnt with vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall love me,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;woo me, kneel to me. Oh! but how I will
      spurn him&mdash;shatter him with my scorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hugh Riversdale!
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the appearance of Helen, the Duke of St Allborne flung over the
      elaborate dissertation to which he was supposed to be listening, and
      quitting Mr Grahame, advanced hastily to his daughter; Lester Vane caught
      sight of her at the same moment, and rose to his feet, but without
      evincing any emotion, other than that of pleasure at her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My deah Miss Gwahame,&rdquo; exclaimed the Duke, all in a flutter of
      excitement, &ldquo;I am twuly delighted that you have wejoined us; I began to
      feah you weah not well, and would afflict us by not wetawning any moah
      this evening. I should have been gweatly gwieved at youah absence, but faw
      moah so if you had been weally indisposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace will, I hope, pardon my not being present with my mamma and
      sisters to receive you in the drawing-room,&rdquo; replied Helen, favouring him
      with one of her most bewitching smiles. &ldquo;I am really ashamed to
      acknowledge to your Grace the truth, but I am afraid that while reading a
      few pages of a novel I fell into the most unromantic doze possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke laughed appreciatively&mdash;a doze after dinner! Who
      comprehended its luxury more keenly than himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pway don&rsquo;t apologise, Miss Gwahame,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I think a nap after
      one&rsquo;s wine one of the wosiest and most delicate awdinations of natchaw.&rdquo;
       Helen smiled bewitchingly again at the Duke, for she knew the eye of
      Lester Vane, who had slowly approached her, was on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord Duke,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;do not misinterpret me&mdash;I dozed after
      my <i>book</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed the Duke. &ldquo;I beg pawdon. Exactly! I could not suppose
      however, Miss Gwahame, that the wine you sipped at dinnaw would have
      thwown you into a doze. I alluded to myself, eh, Vane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weally this girl is devilish pwetty,&rdquo; thought the
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke, as he turned to his friend. &ldquo;She is a pawfect beauty; I must weally
      wun off with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are skilled in after-dinner indulgence, you are, in fact, a perfect
      master of that species of luxury, St. Allbome,&rdquo; replied Vane, smiling, and
      added, with marked <i>empressement</i> to Helen, &ldquo;I would not have done
      you the injustice, Miss Grahame, to have presumed that a <i>post prandial</i>
      slumber had denied us the pleasure of your fair society, if you had not
      yourself offered it in explanation of your absence. I should, if permitted
      to speculate upon your movements, have imagined that a stroll by
      moonlight, along the sinuous paths of the most excellently arranged garden
      attached to this mansion, had occupied you pleasantly, that, tempted by
      the beauty of the night&mdash;or some other cause&mdash;you had been
      induced to linger in the purple shadows thrown upon the place beneath, by
      the luxuriant foliage of a certain cluster of graceful trees, bending in
      pensive reflection over the flowing stream, whose rippling waters lave
      their base, the balmy air responding to the chant of the water&rsquo;s low music
      with soft sighs, and gently fondling in its murmuring the deep green
      leaves still and silent in their evening dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke looked up at his friend in indescribable astonishment. Lester
      Vane went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a scene, Miss Grahame, heightened by those associations your own
      glowing thoughts could supply, would naturally furnish an ample excuse for
      an absence so much regretted by all present. May I suggest that you should
      adopt it, rather than confess to an afterdinner nap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dreams of pumpkin pie,&rdquo; interposed Helen, with sarcastic bitterness,
      and a very formal bend. She understood his allusion; it brought a scarlet
      flush on her cheek, and made her eye flash like a diamond. Her lip curled
      scornfully as she replied to him, and if the sarcastic tone she adopted
      was unnoticed by others, it was not lost upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vane,&rdquo; she added, not concealing an expression of disdain, &ldquo;I prefer
      to adhere to the vulgar truth. There are people to whom such a course is
      inconvenient, but I find it less troublesome than to have to coin a number
      of small prevarications. I am afraid I am rather an unromantic individual.
      I catch cold, and have bad fits of sneezing come on, when I am foolish
      enough to be tempted by some poetical enthusiast to enjoy the beauty of a
      moonlight night, shadowy trees, rippling waters, and sighing breezes. On
      those occasions there is always a quantity of mist about, moist
      exhalations, powerfully suggestive I assure you Mr. Vane, of influenza.
      Moonlight scenes are very pretty things at the Opera, or in a picture, but
      the reality is really very trying to the constitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vewy weflections I have frequently made myself,&rdquo; burst forth the Duke
      with much vivacity. &lsquo;&rsquo;You enwapchaw me, Miss Gwahame, youaw impwes-sions
      squaw so wondwously with mine. Moonlight nights aw vewy damp aflaws; I
      nevaw venchaw upon one without a heavy boat cape, a box of cigaws, and a
      pawson to play the twumpet, to keep me awake, nevaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me, Miss Grahame,&rdquo; said Vane, nettled by the tone she
      assumed. &ldquo;I imagined that your temperament was highly sentimental and
      poetical.&rdquo; There was a hidden meaning even in these words. Helen detected
      so much; though she did not at the moment perceive the object at which the
      shaft was levelled; she replied quickly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been premature, Mr. Vane, in forming your estimate of my
      character. I am not so easily read as my sister Evangeline. She is imbued
      with romance, as, no doubt, you have before this discovered. She trusts to
      seeming, poor child&mdash;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment her eye fastened itself piercingly upon him. She then took
      the Duke&rsquo;s ready arm, and advanced up the <i>salon</i> to a magnificent
      harp, to fulfil a promise made by her to the Duke at dinner. As she did
      so, she looked for Evangeline, but she had quitted the room when Lester
      Vane rose up to greet her, and she liked not her disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester Vane looked after Helen as, with queenly dignity, she paced the
      room, leaning upon the arm of his bulky, ungraceful friend, all the
      brighter and more beautiful for the contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am right,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;I am on the track; she chafes at the very mention
      of garden and moonlight. My experiment, too, succeeds&mdash;two suns may
      not shine in her hemisphere&mdash;she is already jealous of my attention
      to her little, simple, innocent sister. There is power in that. I will use
      it. I will have her completely in my grasp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards Mrs. Grahame and the passionless statue, her daughter
      Margaret, perfectly at his ease, and as unconcerned as though the incident
      of the moment alone occupied his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, too, appeared to commence her task in perfect serenity of mind, yet
      the words, &ldquo;You remember that cross, Helen!&rdquo; were ringing in her brain,
      and though she sang words and music correctly, and never faltered in the
      accompaniment, she prayed for the hour of release from the presence of
      guests, the sounds of voices, the glaring lights; to be again alone in her
      room, to wrestle with memories of passion and promise, to contend with
      conflicting emotions, to decide upon obeying the impulse of her heart, or
      to determine upon one great sacrifice, in order to secure the glittering&rsquo;
      triumphs of a brilliant position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone! What would she not have given at that moment, while singing with
      such charming taste, to have been alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her song commenced, Mr. Grahame had been summoned to an interview
      with some person, who required to see him on business of importance, and
      during the performance of the song, while approving smiles were upon the
      features of his guests, and his wife and daughter Margaret sat in
      ineffable elation, he lay upon the floor of his library in a fit!

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ithin a close,
      narrow, scantily-furnished chamber, upon a miserable bed, sparely provided
      with bedclothes, lay a young girl, weak and wasted, struggling in the
      deadly grip of a fierce fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room&mdash;a back attic&mdash;bore evidence of the humble position of
      the householder, and, in addition to its native foul atmosphere, was
      impregnated with the sickly odour prevalent in chambers in which there is
      sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A truckle bed, a table, a chair, comprised the furniture; a soiled and
      ragged curtain at the diamond-paned window comprehended all the room
      possessed in the shape of drapery or hangings; the walls were bare, and
      washed with the odious salmon-hued distemper colour so prevalent in
      debtors&rsquo; prisons and apartments in poor neighbourhoods; the floor-boards
      with wide interstices between them, and large knot-holes here and there,
      where mice looked up, and unspareable halfpence sometimes rolled down, had
      not even a show of comfort in the way of a small bit of old stair-carpet
      by the bedside. All within and around bespoke poverty of the grimmest
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who lay upon the bed moaning in a disturbed slumber, with
      flushed cheeks, and pale and transparent lips, was no other than Lotte
      Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the night of the fire, when landed safely by the conductor of the
      fire-escape, she found herself in her thin night-dress, exposed to the
      cold night air, which struck chill to her unprotected bosom, while her
      naked tender feet were upon the hard stones, ankle deep in rushing water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock she had experienced on being awakened out of a deep slumber by
      the startling, horrifying cry of fire, the terror which all but paralysed
      her when, half-blinded and nearly suffocated, she discovered her room
      filled with smoke, the excitement which followed the rushing from her
      chamber, the roaring of the flames, the crackling and sputtering of the
      burning wood, the hoarse cries of the mob, the perilous descent to the
      ground, the sudden exposure to the eager gaze of a multitude of faces, red
      in the glaring, unnatural light, the whirl, the turmoil, mingled with a
      species of hysterical joy and gratefulness at her deliverance, created a
      combination of emotions beyond her physical powers of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not wonderful that&mdash;affrighted, unknowing where to turn,
      whither to go, what to do, chilled to the marrow by the piercing coldness
      of the water rushing over her unprotected, delicate feet, utterly
      overwhelmed by what had happened, by the incidents surrounding her, and in
      which she was yet an actor&mdash;she should succumb; and find, that as
      some person hastily and roughly seized her about the waist, she should
      have a dim consciousness that the whole scene was fading from her as some
      expiring terrible vision, and that, when it disappeared from her eyes, she
      should be lifeless in the arms of the person who had caught hold of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had taken her in his arms was a small tradesman, dealing in
      coals and potatoes, and a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;greengrocery.
      He lived in a neighbouring street, in a small house, and was blessed with
      a wife and nine children, who were &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; up somehow. He was one of the
      first on the spot when the alarm of fire was given. He saw Lotte landed
      from the fire-escape; he observed the agonized expression upon the poor
      girl&rsquo;s face&mdash;heard her low, hysteric sobbing, and saw her totter as
      though she would fall upon her face in the muddy, eddying pool in which,
      barefooted, she was standing. It was enough for him. He drew off instantly
      his heavy coat of &ldquo;fashionable cable cord,&rdquo; and, flinging it over her
      shoulders, caught her up in his arms, and raced off to his old &rsquo;oman
      with his burden, followed by a small train of women and boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was no little astonished at this sudden accession to her
      household; but her womanly sympathy was roused immediately she beheld the
      condition of the poor girl, and learned that she had been rescued from the
      raging fire, which her husband had so short a time previously run off to
      see, and she at once busied herself by applying those restoratives, known
      to most women, which, though simple, are efficacious in restoring to
      consciousness those of the sex who fall into swoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte Clinton, being a girl of strong feelings, was not, however, easily
      brought to a calm sense of her great affliction; on the contrary, she
      recovered from one fainting fit only to fall into another, worse than its
      predecessor; and when, by the aid of the parish doctor, who had been
      called in, she was relieved from successive swoons and thrown into a
      sleep, it was only to awake in a paroxysm of fever and delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days she lay thus: on the third, late at night, when the hard-worked
      parish doctor made his appearance, in order that he might see his patient
      the last thing, he stood with the woman of the house, at the bed-side of
      the poor girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three anxious questions were put to him, but he shook his head, as
      the woman thought, ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rapidly approaching a crisis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By the dawn her fate will
      be decided. She has in her favour youth and a good constitution; but it is
      impossible to tell what may result from the ravages of so fierce a fever
      as that under which she is suffering. We must hope for the best, and leave
      the rest in the hands of God! I think it would be proper to make her
      friends acquainted with her condition, and the sooner they are here at her
      bed-side the better will be their chance of taking their last farewell of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were dread words: ill-omened shadows did they cast. The woman raised
      her apron to her eyes, and gulped audibly, once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to find her friends, if she has any, poor child!&rdquo; she
      said, huskily. &ldquo;My Jem picked her up, out o&rsquo; the fire, and brought her
      here; nobody&rsquo;s been to ax after her; and we don&rsquo;t know where to go. She&rsquo;s
      never been in her senses since she was here, else I should have got her to
      tell me; but, lawk! lawk! it is a sad thing for a poor girl like this to
      die away from home, and ne&rsquo;er a friend or relation to close her poor dear
      eyes. I&rsquo;m a mother myself, sir! an&rsquo; God knows, I should be dreadful
      wretched if one of my babbies was to die away from me in this lonesome
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman sobbed unaffectedly as she concluded. The doctor, with a
      glittering tear in the corner of his eye, laid his hand gently upon her
      shoulder&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While there is life there is hope, Mrs. Bantom,&rdquo; he said, kindly. &ldquo;It is
      too early to despair yet. Had the young woman nothing about her when your
      husband saved her?&mdash;no letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you, nothing on but those night things you see on her; not a
      blessed rag else. My Jem has been a trying if he could learn anything
      about her, but lor! he goes about such matters in sech a bladderheaded
      sort o&rsquo; way, that I don&rsquo;t wonder at his making a bad out on it. He lurches
      and prowls about when he goes to ax for his own in sech a way that people
      are afear&rsquo;d on him. It was only the other day he went for a little bill,
      which it was a long time a owin&rsquo; an&rsquo; we wanted the money badly&mdash;when
      he explained what he&rsquo;d come for in sech an in and out round about sort a
      way that the people sent for a policeman believin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d come on the sneak
      to prig the &rsquo;ats and mats in the &rsquo;all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor could hardly forbear a smile. He turned his eyes, however, on
      Lotte&rsquo;s face, and bent his head down closely to listen to her breathing,
      he felt her pulse, timing its rapid beats by his watch; then he laid down
      the unresisting hand, and addressed himself to Mrs. Ban tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is very, very ill. If she wakes shortly, give
      to her a dose of the medicine I have brought with me&mdash;she must have
      it, especially if she be violent, incoherent, and resists your attempts to
      administer it. Should it not have the effect of pacifying her, send for me
      at once. Good night, Mrs. Bantom. Pray to God to spare her, for she is on
      the threshold of death,&rdquo; he concluded, with much solemnity in his tone. He
      made his way out of the room. She lighted him down the stairs, and when
      she heard the street-door close she returned to the sick room to watch by
      the side of her friendless patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband and her children were in bed; he had his long hard day&rsquo;s work
      to perform on the morrow, and rest was essential to him. The little colony
      of children were better where they were than anywhere else; Mrs. Bantom,
      too, had her share of hard work cut out for her for the next day and
      required sleep, but she did not heed it. She thought only of the poor
      young creature who she believed to be rapidly quitting her brief earthly
      career for one that would have no limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the feeble rays of the miserable rushlight burning, she watched the
      flushed face of Lotte, perceiving it become each minute more crimson and
      inflamed-She saw her bosom heave and fall, and she listened with a beating
      heart to her stertorous breathing. She saw her head roll from side to
      side, her burning hands open and shut, and clutch at the bed-clothes. She
      heard with an aching heart the low moan of pain which oozed as it were
      with prolonged mournful cadence from the lips of the poor girl, and she
      prepared for the sudden and violent awakening to which the doctor had
      alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lotte became silent and motionless again; the only change in her was,
      that her tongue, white and rigid, protruded from her half-opened mouth.
      The heart of good Mrs. Bantom smote her as she observed it, and she feared
      that the fatal moment was indeed at hand. She, however, performed her duty
      as a nurse with watchful perseverance, and with some grapes which the
      doctor had brought, she moistened the dry and parched tongue of poor
      Lotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentle attention, persevered in, passed not unrewarded. She could see
      it had a grateful influence; though, as it seemed to her, Lotte was dying
      in an unconscious state, and would breathe her last without making any
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, though she knew only the prayers taught to her in childhood, and
      seldom now-a-days went to a place of worship, she remembered the words of
      the doctor, and she knelt down by the bedside. She was unacquainted with
      the subtleties of contending faiths. She had a faith which went deeper:
      she believed implicitly in the supreme power of God, in His ability to
      give and to take away. In that spirit she appealed to Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She prayed to Him, in earnest sincerity, to grant to the motionless,
      friendless girl, stretched on the bed before her, a longer term, if that,
      by a more extended sojourn on earth, she might know a greater happiness
      than had, perhaps, yet been her lot; but that, if it was the Divine will
      to remove her hence, she implored Him with earnest heart, though with all
      humility and reverence, to take her to His bosom, that the shadow of
      sorrow or affliction might fall upon her never more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her prayer was ended, she turned her eyes, suffused with tears, upon
      her unconscious patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. The hectic crimson of the girl&rsquo;s cheek had paled down, and
      was fast changing to a pallid hue. It seemed even that on her brow a
      moisture had appeared. The heavy breathing had abated, as had the moaning
      and uneasy movement of head and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Lotte&rsquo;s eyes opened, and she gazed feebly around her. She looked
      intently at the bare walls, the scanty furniture, and then earnestly upon
      Mrs. Bantom, who was watching her every motion with absorbing eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in a low voice, she murmured, wonderingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where am I? Who are you? What strange place is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bantom&rsquo;s own common sense told her that the crisis was over; and, so
      far, the girl&rsquo;s life was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a burst of gratitude, she exclaimed, clasping her hands together&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, you have listened to my prayer! you have heard me, a sinner!
      you have spared her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears checked her voice, and she buried her face once more in the
      bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte regarded her with surprise&mdash;as, indeed, she did the whole
      situation. She felt strangely weak and powerless. Had she been ill? What
      did it all mean? She repeated the question, in a low voice, and then Mrs.
      Bantom jumped up, and hurried to the medicine bottle. She poured out a
      dose, and said, as tenderly as if Lotte was her own child&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, drink that, like a good girl, and don&rsquo;t ask a single question
      until you are stronger; it will be quite time enough to know all then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lotte would have persisted, but Mrs. Bantom was peremptory, and she was
      obliged to succumb. Within ten minutes after the medicine had been
      administered, she was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle had been fought. Youth, constitution, and judicious treatment
      had won the victory. The abatement of the symptoms was as rapid as had
      been the attack of the fever, and in two days more Lotte was able to sit
      up in bed, and communing with herself, come to a full knowledge of the
      peculiarity and the distressing nature of her situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, in the interval between the crisis and the present moment,
      followed the directions of the doctor, obeyed his instructions, and
      swallowed his medicine with the intrepidity of a martyr. The result had
      been all that could be desired in her progress to health: fresh air was
      only needed to complete the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was that to be got at? How, at present, could she obtain more than
      came in at her window? She had no clothes; all had been destroyed at the
      fire, everything had been consumed, including the very little money she
      had. Her very first impulse had been, on coming to a sense of her
      position, to send for her brother Charley; but, alas! a fellow-clerk had
      embezzled upwards of a thousand pounds from the firm to which they both
      belonged, and had absconded. Charley had been at once charged to accompany
      a detective, engaged to pursue him, to America, and he had started on the
      very night of the fire. He was already on the Atlantic, leaving the shores
      of England at the rate of three hundred miles per day. He had despatched a
      hasty note to Lotte, informing her of the mission upon which he had been
      despatched, and directing her, should she require a little pecuniary
      assistance during his absence, to apply in his name to his firm, and it
      would be readily afforded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter she never got. Charley had slipped it into the letter-box of a
      post-office, on his way to the Euston station, and it was conveyed to its
      destination by the postman on the following morning. But as he was not
      able to deliver it, he returned to the Dead Letter Office, first carefully
      writing upon it, &ldquo;House burnt down; gone away, not known where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bantom was, however, employed by Lotte as a messenger to her brother,
      to inform him of her sad misfortune, but he pursued his inquiries for
      Charley in a manner so mysterious, that he raised in the mind, of the
      Clerk whom he addressed a strong impression that Charley Clinton was
      deeply his debtor, for coals and greengrocery. Now, Charley&rsquo;s fellow-clerk
      was never out of debt, and had an intense loathing for all creditors; they
      were, he used to say, so offensively pertinacious even when they had got
      an answer, therefore he replied to Mr. Bantom&rsquo;s questions with curt
      brevity. All Mr. Bantom could gather was, that Charles Clinton had sailed
      for America, and his return was a question involved in obscurity. And the
      clerk facetiously added, &ldquo;It might not be for years, and it might not be
      for never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This intelligence was a sad blow to Lotte; what to do she could not tell.
      The honest people who had taken her in to their humble house lived too
      closely from hand to mouth to aid her; indeed, she was already a burden to
      them; they could ill&mdash;nay, could not&mdash;afford to keep her; this
      she was at no loss to comprehend by what she heard and saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her passion of bitter, bitter tears on learning that Charley had
      gone to another quarter of the globe, had passed away, she consulted with
      Mrs. Bantom as to what was to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot lie here,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;I shall worry myself to death. If I
      could get out, I could get work. I could in some way repay you for your
      kindness, Mrs. Bantom, but to be kept thus&mdash;oh, I had better died&mdash;
      better have died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrung her hands, and sobbed violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; no use your taking on in this way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bantom to her,
      ready to mingle her tears with her, for to say truth, the poor creature
      was easily moved to weep. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;ll turn up, I&rsquo;ll be bound. My
      things is too big for you&mdash;and too poor&mdash;besides, I ain&rsquo;t got
      much more&rsquo;n I stand upright in, but I dare say I shall hit on a way to
      dress you afore long, so don&rsquo;t worrit yourself. As for the bit you eats&mdash;lor!
      what&rsquo;s that among so many on us? there, there, hold your tongue, gal, and
      keep your spirits up; I&rsquo;ll find a way to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so she did. She went among her neighbours to make up the different
      articles that constitute the dress of a woman, and poor, as nearly all of
      whom she begged were, none, when they heard Lotte&rsquo;s frightful story,
      refused her appeal. The poor never refuse to help the poor, if they have
      any means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last application, however, should have been her first, for it was to a
      young girl about Lotte&rsquo;s own age and figure. She was an artificial
      florist, a worker, too, of eighteen hours out of the twenty-four&mdash;a
      diligent, unmurmuring, white slave. She was able to sympathise with poor
      Lotte, and she generously offered to lend her all the clothes she would
      require, until she obtained work, and would be able to return them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With delight Mrs. Bantom accepted her offer, and conveyed the clothes to
      Lotte. With yet greater delight did the poor girl attire herself in them,
      and hurry to the house for which she had worked before the fire had
      rendered her homeless. She revealed her unhappy position to the individual
      who had employed her (there are few like him, thank Heaven!) He listened
      coldly to her statement, and finding that six dozen cap fronts, his
      property, had been consumed in the fire, instead of commiserating her,
      abruptly informed her that she must pay for the blonde and flowers before
      she had any more work, and if in two days she did not bring to him the
      amount, he would pay her a visit accompanied by a policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sickened and affrighted, Lotte hurried from the house, her hopes once more
      dashed to the ground, her heart bursting with agony, no one to go to for
      counsel or assistance. What was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost frantic, she wandered about without an aim, feeling that she could
      not go back to the kind people who had sheltered her, unless she had some
      prospect of lifting herself out of her desolate destitution, and
      recompensing them, at least, for her board, although she could never repay
      the service and the attention they had rendered to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered through the streets, growing weak and faint from an exertion
      to which she was not equal, and from being many hours without food,
      gradually becoming desperate, as hopeless. She thought of the coming night
      and the dark waters that swept silently beneath the frowning arches of the
      bridges which spanned their breadth, and an ever-recurring thought kept
      ringing in her ears&mdash; <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"Anywhere,
      anywhere&mdash; <br /><span class="indent25">Out of the world,&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      suddenly her eyes fell upon a printed bill; it said: &ldquo;One thousand
      cap-front hands wanted!&rdquo; Not a second elapsed between her discovery of
      that bill and the resting of her trembling hand upon the knocker of the
      door. Her timid summons was responded to, and her application for work met
      with success.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was requested to enter a room and to sit down, and &ldquo;make a pattern.&rdquo;
       She was furnished with materials, and it was not long before she produced
      a &ldquo;front,&rdquo; which gave great satisfaction to the employer. The answers to
      inquiries put to her being deemed satisfactory, materials for twelve dozen
      fronts were given to her, in a box, which she was to return with her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a light heart and a heavy parcel she returned to Mrs. Bantom.
      Constant work was promised to her, provided she was punctual, and her work
      was approved of. She had no fears about that. She promised the work on the
      following Friday night. The task could only be accomplished by incessant
      toil, but she resolved to accomplish it, and she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little squalid bedroom she sat to her exacting toil; few were the
      hours of sleep she obtained during the time between the commencement and
      the close of her labours, but she was rewarded by completing the last
      front within an hour of the time specified. More fit for bed than for a
      journey through the crowded streets, she staggered rather than walked to
      the house of her new employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her work was given in, and it was commended. She was told to come the
      following evening, at six, the time when the workers were paid, and bring
      her book, when she would receive the money due to her, and more work would
      be given to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elated, she returned to her poor abode, and slept happily that night at
      least. She had in five days and nights&mdash;there was not much to be
      taken out for sleep&mdash;earned ten shillings. She hoped the next week to
      earn a like sum, and by self-sacrifices, assisted by the kind forbearance
      of the Bantoms, to gradually clear off her debt, and to get herself
      clothes, which she should wear with the satisfaction that they were her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! she raised up wonderful and glittering fabrics, but they were based
      upon most intangible foundations. However, she slumbered lightly, and rose
      refreshed, busying herself the whole of the day in lightening Mrs.
      Bantom&rsquo;s labours by assisting her in attending to her small regiment of
      blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock the next evening punctually, and with anxious hopes, she
      stood before the house of her new employer. She looked up wistfully at it.
      It wore a peculiar air of silence and dulness which she had not before
      observed. She did not pause to think upon the impression thus suddenly
      raised, but knocked at the door. A pang smote her breast as it occurred to
      her that a hollow sound echoed through the house on the fall of the
      knocker, as though it was empty. She instinctively again cast her eyes
      upwards; the windows were all closed; there were no blinds, but all was
      dark within the house, and so still&mdash;so dreadfully still.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited: her summons remained unanswered. She knocked again. The same
      hollow sound reverberated through the building, and her heart began to
      sink and die within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young girl now came up, stopped at the door, and knocked. She was bound
      upon the same errand as Lotte, save that a fortnight&rsquo;s work was due to
      her. She had scrambled and starved over the past week, she scarcely knew
      how. Wan and weak, but full of hope, she was here for the miserable sum
      for which she had bartered health, exhausted her strength, and perilled
      her young life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer to her knock at the door, save the same hollow mocking
      echo, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another girl made her appearance; a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth; all
      here upon one errand&mdash;to claim the scanty sum for which they had
      worked, almost from dawn to dawn. They spoke to each other, questioningly:
      they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes with dread apprehension, and they
      conversed in low excited tones. The wages they had come to receive had
      been earned with a death-sweat. It was to them of vital consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two had homes and parents upon whom to fall back for assistance;
      but the loss of the money to the others left them only a choice between
      the streets and the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte grasped at a railing near her for support. A throng of sharp ringing
      sounds rushed through her brain. She took no part in the conversation. She
      could not have uttered a sound, her tongue clave to the roof of her mouth,
      her throat swelled and contracted as though it would stifle her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to lose her perception of what was going on around her.
      Everything seemed to be absorbed in a harrowing consciousness that her
      beggary, her loneliness, and desolation had assumed proportions of more
      terrible magnitude than they had ever yet done&mdash;that they surpassed
      her power to endure them longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a dim impression that a person residing next door told them all
      that their employer had fled with his goods ere daybreak, no one knew
      whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sickened, heart-broken, Lotte quitted her hold of the railing which had
      sustained her, and staggered away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not difficult to find her way to the black and murky river,
      careering swiftly and noiselessly through the heart of the vast metropolis
      down to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The river! the river!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were the only words she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of such terrible significance seemed to be shrieked by demons
      in her ears She saw them in fiery characters dancing <i>ignis-fatuus</i>
      like, before her, leading her on to her doom. She followed unresistingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she found her way&mdash;what route she chose to the river-side&mdash;she
      knew not, cared not. She reached a bridge that spanned the dark waters,
      ere she was conscious of her proximity to that grave which could be
      self-made by one desperate plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the fearful act she contemplated presented itself in its most
      awful guise before her despairing eyes, but not to deter her from her
      frantic purpose. No! If she remained on earth, her future was all black
      and unshapen. There was rest and immunity from the horrors of want and
      destitution in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt down and prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She compressed her hands tightly together; a wild hysteric groan, forced
      from her by the intense anguish created by her unutterable thoughts, burst
      from her lips, and she hurried on to the bridge, to end, by one fearful
      plunge, her sorrows and her young life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she swept on to a recess, blinded by her misery, maddened by a despair
      devoid of one glimmering of hope, the glare from one of the lamps fell
      upon her ghastly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a strong hand caught her by the wrist, and a friendly
      voice exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Clinton! Miss Clinton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell back against the parapet of the bridge, and the voice changed its
      tone for one of horror and surprise, and it said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven! what is the matter with you? how deadly white you are! What
      has happened?&mdash;where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die!&mdash;to die!&rdquo;&mdash;she murmured, hoarsely, but faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! my dear friend,&rdquo; said he who stayed her, in a soft and
      slightly reproving tone, and added&mdash;&ldquo;calm yourself, I entreat you; do
      not speak for a minute or so; collect your thoughts, and then turn your
      eyes on me. I am a friend. I have a right to that title, and you will
      acknowledge it presently. I claim to aid you in affliction or trial. You
      will not, I am sure, Miss Clinton, refuse consolation or help in need from
      Harry Vivian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lotte uttered a faint, hysteric cry; she clutched his arm, and bowed her
      head upon his breast. She knew he had the power to help her; she knew he
      would. As she clung to him, he felt her frame tremble and quiver as though
      she had been smitten with an ague, and her hot tears fell fast upon the
      hand which held hers, and pressed it re-assuringly. He let her weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, he whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not stay here, Lotte. It is chill and cold, and we excite
      attention from the passers-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He conducted her from the bridge but a few steps only, for she was nearly
      powerless, and unable longer to continue the struggle without fatigue. He
      quickly perceived it, and had some notion of the cause; so he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad I have found you at last. I have made many efforts, since
      the night of the fire, to discover you, but in vain. Not alone to satisfy
      my own anxiety respecting you, but to allay the apprehensions of your
      friend. Miss Wilton, to whom you were so kind in her hour of bitter trial.
      Ah, Lotte! her misery is all past, her future life promises to be one of
      supreme happiness, if wealth and station can ensure it. Come to her now:
      she so wishes to see you again. It is not so far: a cab will quickly take
      us to her. You will have, at least, a kindly sympathetic ear in which to
      pour your sorrows, and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the meeting between you may
      be the termination of all your trials and sufferings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lotte tried to reply. An inarticulate murmur was all that escaped her
      lips. Her deep emotion did not so easily admit of suppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab opportunely approached, and Hal engaged it. He lifted Lotte in: she
      had not power to help herself. He followed her into the vehicle, and gave
      his directions to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whipped his horse, and the cab rattled away from the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte thought of the sombre river, whirling on grimly, and she shuddered
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gloomiest lane, Lotte,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;sometimes leads us to the
      brightest land.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Grahame&rsquo;s
      dissertation upon the improvement of land and the general economy and
      management of estates had been abruptly interrupted by the entrance of his
      daughter into the room where the guests and family were assembled. His
      apathetic and somewhat drowsy auditor, the young Duke, immediately on
      observing the approach of Helen Grahame, with a slight excuse to his host,
      emancipated himself from the dull topic droned into his ears, and advanced
      hastily to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the same moment, Whelks entered the apartment, with a printed
      card upon a silver salver. It was <i>not</i> an elegant production&mdash;the
      typography was bold and in effect smudgy, and the general get-up smacked
      rather loudly of the Seven Dials&rsquo; press.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dingy, too, and nibbled at the corners, indicating cogitation on
      the part of the person whom it represented, the pasteboard having been
      used unconsciously instead of the grimy thumb-nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick eye of Mr. Grahame caught sight of it almost the instant Whelks
      crossed the threshold of the door, carrying it very much with the air of
      one who had a huge slug on a plate, which he was seeking the earliest
      opportunity to dispose of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s eyes flashed fire. What could the idiot mean by bringing to
      him such a dun, drabby bit of card at such a moment. He glared at Whelks,
      who remained unaffected; his gaze was upon the soiled article he carried,
      and his reflections far away into the future, resting upon the rosy hour
      when, liberated from flunkeydom, he should, with Sarah the cook, unite
      hands and savings, and go into business. It was not, he thought, with such
      &ldquo;a hinfamous fustian smelling objek&rdquo; as that which rested on the silver
      salver, as though it had no business there, that he should make his
      business announcement to a British public, bursting with a desire to deal
      with him. And as he dreamed thus, he reached his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grahame and Margaret Claverhouse, both with an astonishment and
      indignation which their indomitable pride could barely repress, saw upon
      the silver salver, in the hands of Whelks, the offensively dusky, shabby
      card, and if glances could slay, Whelks&rsquo; remains would have been spread
      over the magnificently &ldquo;Sang"-decorated walls. Hewas, however, as we have
      said, all unconscious of the effect he was creating upon the members of
      the household, and he reached Mr. Gra-hame only to perceive him glowering
      upon him like a tiger, inflamed with most sanguinary intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a low, guttural growl, he was about to make known to Whelks the
      nature of his convictions in having, at such an inopportune moment, thrust
      upon him so foul a communication, when his eye caught sight of the name&mdash;printed,
      according to the trade term, in fat-faced Egyptian&mdash;of Chewkle. He
      felt as if some one had suddenly smote him on the head with a club, and he
      broke into a cold sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was in possession of his horrid secret; he was in his power; at
      any time he could blazon forth to the world that a Grahame, the proudest
      of a proud family, had committed a base act of forgery. He was now
      amenable to the law of transportation&mdash;liable to be torn from his
      present high position, and compelled to work and toil with thieves and
      scoundrels in a penal colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections, none the less vivid for presenting themselves in that
      brilliantly lighted room, and in the presence of guests of high birth,
      made his face grow white, and his knees tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whipped up the card and thrust it into his pocket, hoping that it had
      escaped the eyes of all but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whelks delivered, then, an urgent message from Chewkle, and Mr. Grahame
      said, in a low tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the &rsquo;orl, sir,&rdquo; returned the footman, with a perked-up nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him into the library; I will come to him immediately,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
      Grahame, in the same tone as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whelks bowed, and departed to obey the instructions he had received, and
      then to discuss with Sarah the nature of the business of a &ldquo;Kermission
      Agent,&rdquo; as he styled Chewkle&rsquo;s occupation, and wherefore it should, as it
      appeared to him that it most certainly did, obtain so great an influence
      over such a man as Mr. Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame perceiving that Helen had absorbed the attention of the Duke
      and Lester Vane, glided out of the room into the library. As he entered it
      he became conscious of a strong smell of the &ldquo;fragrant weed,&rdquo; which,
      however, to his olfactory nerves had not &ldquo;the scent of the rose,&rdquo; and he
      saw Mr. Chewkle, with part of a truly British cheroot in his hand,
      standing near to the lamp upon the table, harassed by doubts as to the
      propriety of relighting it or the propriety of doing nothing of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame bowed patronisingly, but said hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not smoking, I hope, Mr. Chewkle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Chewkle; &ldquo;it was out afore I came in, but I thought if you
      didn&rsquo;t mind, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, indeed, I do mind!&rdquo; responded Mr. Grahame, quickly, and then added
      most fiercely, as he perceived the red and begrimed face of his visitor,
      his dirty collar, his necktie and his hair disordered, all indicating the
      frequent quaffing and replenishment of &ldquo;the glass which cheers&rdquo; and <i>does</i>
      inebriate&mdash;&ldquo;Pray tell me, Mr. Chewkle, to what circumstance I am to
      attribute your visit at, to me, a most inconvenient time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, things happens without particularly caring for our
      convenience,&rdquo; answered Chewkle, with a hiccup, which left a strong odour
      of some beverage&mdash;not green tea&mdash;behind it. &ldquo;We would all like
      things to fall out jest as we would wish &lsquo;em, but they don&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; it seems
      as if the more you wish &rsquo;em the more they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Grahame, not liking this preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Chewkle, &ldquo;an&rsquo; when things run cross, we must, if we
      wants to right &rsquo;em, go to work at once, without caring about
      convenience. At least, them&rsquo;s my sentiments, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s my way o&rsquo; doing
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very proper way, no doubt, my good friend,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame,
      growing yet more anxious, &ldquo;but pray tell me what <i>has</i> happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a very orkurd matter, as things stand,&rdquo; replied Mr. Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, just this&mdash;old Wilton&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, out o&rsquo; quod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out&mdash;out&mdash;out of prison?&rdquo; gasped Mr. Grahame, clutching at a
      chair for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else,&rdquo; replied Chewkle, placing his hands behind him, and rocking
      himself backwards and forwards on his toes and heels, in a very dangerous
      fashion for one in his state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaped&mdash;escaped?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Grahame, his eyes almost starting
      out of their sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such luck!&rdquo; answered Chewkle, &ldquo;if he had, he&rsquo;d a&rsquo; soon been nabbed
      agen, and taken back to ha&rsquo; been kept closer than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&mdash;speak out, man! you are inflicting upon me
      indescribable torture!&rdquo; exclaimed Grahame, excitedly. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he
      dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! no; he&rsquo;s got more lives than a cat, he has. No, sir; he&rsquo;s out of
      quod because he&rsquo;s been and paid all the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid the money!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Grahame, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every mag of it, sir&mdash;every farthing. He has wiped off the detainer
      lodged at the gate agen&rsquo; him, and he is free to roam about agen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame stood as if thunder-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he ejaculated, like one in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact, sir, all the same for that. I saw Scathe, the managing clerk to
      your solicitor, and he told me all about it. The debts and costs is paid,
      and Wilton is out. The money has been paid under protest, sir; so you
      can&rsquo;t touch a penny on it until you&rsquo;ve proved your right to it by a
      haction-at-law. Scathe says he don&rsquo;t think anything o&rsquo; that, because the
      firm holds a dockyment, which Wilton has signed in your favour, as &rsquo;ll
      put him out o&rsquo; court slap. Now, what I wants to know is this&mdash;is the
      dockyment he spoke of the same as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame clutched his wrist, looked around him with trepidation, and
      raised his finger warningly. Mr. Chewkle hiccuped again, and lowered his
      tone, and added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the same as&mdash;as&mdash;as you signed for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame drew a deep breath, but made no reply. Chewkle was a shrewd
      reader of physiognomy, and obtained the information he sought from the
      distorted workings of Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s haggard features. He gave vent to his
      sensations on learning what he sought to know, in a low, prolonged
      whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things is wuss than I took them to be,&rdquo; he murmured. Then he addressed
      Mr. Grahame. &ldquo;Who do you think?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;it is as has been making
      himself so very hactive in getting old Wilton out o&rsquo; Hudson&rsquo;s Hotel *
      &mdash;you won&rsquo;t guess. Why it&rsquo;s that little saffron-jawed imidge, who
      dropped in so unexpected when you jest finished that bit o&rsquo; writing for
      the hobstinate Wilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Queen&rsquo;s Bench.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped Grahame, &ldquo;has <i>he</i> assisted Wilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid the money, I believe, sir; and is going to stand his friend in the
      law case,&rdquo; observed Chewkle, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grahame clasped his hands and paced the room in agitation, he passed his
      feverish fingers convulsively over his temples. &ldquo;What is to be done&mdash;what
      is to be done?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I have commenced to act upon that accursed
      document. I thought he never, never would come out of prison, but would
      die there; and urged by the frightfully pressing nature of my necessity&mdash;my
      situation in connection with the estates to which I lay claim&mdash;I
      lodged the deed with my lawyer, and ordered him to proceed upon it. He has
      commenced&mdash;I know he has commenced; the deed is registered&mdash;all
      will be discovered, and&mdash;oh, my God! what will ensue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transportation for life to a dead certainty,&rdquo; replied Chewkle, in slow,
      emphatic tones, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be called upon to prove the signatur&mdash;you
      can&rsquo;t do that; then, o&rsquo; course it&rsquo;s a forgery. Well, who did it? You got
      to show how you come by it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do that; and then you&rsquo;ll be
      found guilty, and sentenced for life. That&rsquo;s clear, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle felt himself, at the conclusion of his speech, seized by the
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain,&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, froth foaming and bubbling from his mouth.
      &ldquo;This was your hellish counsel; but for your infernal suggestion and
      complicity, I should never have thought of it, but you shall share my fate&mdash;my
      fate&mdash;transportation. Oh! horror, horror&mdash;my house&mdash;my
      family! I&mdash;I&mdash;death&mdash;death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle felt the cold clammy fingers of his antagonist loosen, and as
      the last words died on his lips, he saw him stagger back, and before he
      could catch him, he fell to the ground in a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle&rsquo;s first impulse was to call for help, but instantly it flashed
      across his mind that he should have a thousand questions to answer,
      besides being regarded with looks of distrust and suspicion. He had no
      wish, at that hour, and in the rather free style and state of his costume,
      to have to encounter the family, to explain that which it was so important
      should be left unexplained, and he proceeded to attempt himself to play
      the part of a medical attendant. Mr. Chewkle was stronger than he looked,
      and he had need of all his strength to pin Mr. Grahame to the floor,
      during the violent paroxysms of the fit by which he had been seized. He
      succeeded, by dint of tremendous exertion, in overmastering the desperate
      struggles of the prostrate man, and when they had ceased, he loosened his
      neckcloth, obtained some water from a bottle upon the table, bathed his
      temples and lips with it until Mr. Grahame opened his eyes, and gazed
      wildly around him, like one waking up out of some dreadful dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few incoherent expressions, he became once more alive to his
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down his library, wringing his hands, and displaying the
      greatest possible mental anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he paused before Chewkle, and with a stern countenance, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through blindly following your counsel, I have placed myself in a
      situation of awful peril. Tell me, what must be done to avoid the dreadful
      degradation with which I am threatened&mdash;how is this frightful false
      step to be retrieved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by going on, sir, as if you&rsquo;d gone stark, staring mad!&rdquo; answered
      Chewkle, rather brusquely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal at stake, you know; and
      there&rsquo;s only one way to make the best of a bad game&mdash;that&rsquo;s by being
      as cool as hice, and as clear about the head-piece. You must be slow to
      think and decide, but prompt to hact. You are in a mess, that&rsquo;s pretty
      certain; the only way to get out of it, is to be quite calm and easy-like,
      to calculate your chances carefully, to say not a word to nobody but them
      you must employ, and fight it out to the last, hinch for hinch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This advice seemed tolerably sound, but Mr. Grahame could not reflect
      calmly, nor calculate coldly; he could do nothing but have shifting
      visions of the happy time of youth, when he was free from the cares and
      responsibilities of life, and of the grim, shadowy, future, lying behind a
      curtain of black and obscure vapour; they were mingled in one picture,
      whirling and rioting through his aching brain, and incapacitating him from
      sitting down to plan a scheme, by which he might escape the consequences
      of the crime he had committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; he said, at length, impatiently, &ldquo;to expect from me, in
      my present excitement, any suggestion dictated by cool reflection. My
      brain is in chaotic confusion; it is racked with agony. I feel that
      something must instantly be done, but what&mdash;what, my good Chewkle,
      cannot you devise something?&mdash;you are cooler than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, if the wust comes to the wust, sir,&rdquo; responded Mr.
      Chewkle, calculatingly, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be hit so hard as you; I can afford to
      be cooler; now my notion is, that the first thing to be done is to get
      hold of that jeuced dockyment, and when got hold on, to drop it quietly
      into the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good thought; I&rsquo;ll send for it at once to my solicitor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be at the hoffice now,&rdquo; interposed Chewkle. &ldquo;You must let me
      manage it. I&rsquo;ll be with &rsquo;em afore nine to morrow morning, so as to
      bust upon &rsquo;em afore they opens their letters, or commences looking
      at papers which have been served on &rsquo;em in different causes, an&rsquo;
      I&rsquo;ll be in such a fluster an&rsquo; hurry to get back to you, that I&rsquo;ll get the
      dockyment out of &rsquo;em, instead of being put off with a promise to
      look it out and send it by a clerk. We can&rsquo;t wait, you know; we <i>must</i>
      have it; and you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;ll bring it back with me all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My best of friends, how can I reward you?&rdquo; said Mr. Grahame, clutching at
      hope and relief from the scheme proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Chewkle, &ldquo;a tenner will do for me jest now; I ain&rsquo;t
      greedy, though I am short of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame was here made to understand that a ten pound note was needed;
      he drew one promptly from his purse, and gave it to Chewkle, who instantly
      transferred it to his badly worn portmonnaie, which he plunged into the
      depths of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must write a note&mdash;a strong note&mdash;to your solicitor, sir,&rdquo;
       he observed, when the money was stowed away, &ldquo;directing him to give to <i>me</i>
      the deed&mdash;mention my name&mdash;immediately on the receipt of your
      note&mdash;dash under &lsquo;immediately&rsquo;&mdash;that will throw him off his
      guard; he will give the dockyment to me; I&rsquo;ll bring it to you, and then
      you can destroy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is registered, and that will afford proof that there was such a
      document,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Grahame, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that there was, perhaps,&rdquo; answered Chewkle; &ldquo;but what of that?&mdash;who&rsquo;s
      to prove &rsquo;andwriting on a thing that ain&rsquo;t forthcoming?&mdash;who&rsquo;s
      to substantiate a charge of forgery&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s to substantiate such a charge upon a thing as don&rsquo;t exist&mdash;that
      can&rsquo;t be put in in support of the case. It can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but what if proceedings have already commenced, and my lawyer
      is prepared to put in that deed to bar the claim they will make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he musn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if he has this very day? for I urged him to proceed with all
      speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then we must be prepared to prove that it <i>is</i> Wilton&rsquo;s
      signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it <i>is</i> his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Zackly. I don&rsquo;t want more in this affair than ourselves, but we
      musn&rsquo;t be beat while there is a chance of winning. Suppose I swears I saw
      him sign the deed, and suppose old Jukes swears <i>he</i> saw him do it,
      and suppose his follerers, Sudds and dirty Nutty, swears they stood by,
      and saw it signed&mdash;how then? There&rsquo;s nothing can be brought against
      us to invalidate our evidence, and what could the hother side do then? Old
      Wilton will swear, of course, hard and fast, that he did not sign, but
      what then?&mdash;you don&rsquo;t appear in the matter? you commissioned me to
      get it signed, and I brings forard three respectable men, who swears&mdash;swears,
      mind&mdash;they saw him sign it; who&rsquo;ll be believed then? he wouldn&rsquo;t have
      a leg to stand on. These men will be difficult to get, but they&rsquo;ve got
      their price, sir, and are to be had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All these remarks and suggestions, rascally as they were, afforded comfort
      to Mr. Grahame. They conveyed to him a glimmering of hope that the
      difficulty, after all, was not so desperate as he had presumed it to be.
      He recoiled at the notion of having to work with such dirty instruments&mdash;when,
      however, did dishonesty and crime ever work with other tools?&mdash;but he
      did not recoil at the work itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain a vast advantage, at the price of the misery and destruction of
      another, would not have occasioned him a moment&rsquo;s remorse, or in any
      degree have ruffled his equanimity or serenity, but to accomplish that
      task by the aid of a small knot of low rascals, was the source of extreme
      annoyance and vexation to him. Still if the object could not be obtained
      without such assistance, he elected to employ it rather than forego his
      purpose; they were the means to the end at which he sought to arrive,
      disagreeable enough, but necessary to the result&mdash;and, as such,
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternative of stoutly maintaining the forged signature of Wilton to
      be genuine, had not struck him. The suggestion was a valuable one, and he
      resolved to treasure it up. It occurred to him that his own word would
      have weight in a Court of Justice, from the high position which he held in
      society, and if he repudiated having had anything to do with the
      signature, or of having been present when it was being signed&mdash;he
      would in all probability be believed, not alone because it would seem the
      natural course for him, wanting the signature, to have pursued to obtain
      it, but because it would be considered incredible that he had descended to
      any unworthy artifice or to crime even, to have possessed himself of it.
      Its return to his own possession was, however, of the first importance;
      its destruction would raise another question, to be settled hereafter. So
      he sat down, and penned the letter to his solicitor, the outlines of which
      Chewkle had supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he completed it, and inclosed it in an envelope, he said to Chewkle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am disturbed to learn that Mr. Gomer has interested himself in Wilton&rsquo;s
      favour. That fact tells rather against my interests. He is a singular man
      is Mr. Gomer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing&rsquo;lar, sir,&rdquo; echoed Chewkle; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s as yallar as a canary; he&rsquo;s
      everywhere at once, and people says he&rsquo;s as rich as &lsquo;creeses,&rsquo; though why
      <i>they</i> should be called rich I never could understand, unless it is
      they grows in profusion, an&rsquo; you get &rsquo;em at six bunches a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very extraordinary man,&rdquo; said Grahame, musingly; &ldquo;a very
      extraordinary man&mdash;enormously wealthy. I fear the man&mdash;I fear
      him. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I feel terrified in his presence, and I shudder
      when I think of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is orful hugly, and that is the truth,&rdquo; observed Chewkle,
      emphatically, adding, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk about him, sir, or I&rsquo;m blow&rsquo;d if you
      won&rsquo;t find him at your elber. Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see him walk out
      o&rsquo; the dark at the end of the room there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, with a slight shudder, as Chewkle jerked
      his thumb over his left shoulder to the part of the room then in shadow.
      To confess the truth, he would not have been surprised, though he might
      have been appalled, to have seen the apparition of Nathan Gomer in the
      spot pointed out, but he would not appear to acknowledge so much to
      Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished the superscription of the note, and handed it to his agent,
      saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will deliver this to the principal of the firm, and I presume I may
      expect you here about ten tomorrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will all depend upon what time the principal comes to business in the
      morning, sir,&rdquo; answered, Chewkle, &ldquo;but I shall be there afore the postman,
      and I&rsquo;ll have the deed safe enough, depend on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was this business alone that induced you to come here
      to-night?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Grahame, almost fearing to ask, in case there
      might be further unpleasant communications for him to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothen&rsquo; else, sir,&rdquo; returned Chewkle, although the bank note was the
      principal occasion of his visit. &ldquo;When I learned the news about Wilton, I
      thought it my duty to lose no time in letting you know&mdash;knowing what
      I knowed, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes&mdash;quite right&mdash;you did quite right,&rdquo; observed
      Grahame, hastily. &ldquo;Let me see you with the deed as early as you can in the
      morning. Good night, Chewkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame rang for Whelks as he spoke, and was promptly answered by the
      immediate appearance of his man, who had applied his ear to the keyhole
      with most persevering zeal, in the hope to unravel the mystery of
      Chewkle&rsquo;s audiences with his proud and haughty master, but he had caught
      nothing&mdash;but the ear-ache, which subsequently took him for a walk up
      and down his bedroom all night, to the doctor&rsquo;s in the morning, afterwards
      to Covent Garden Market for poppy heads, and subsequently it treated
      itself to scorching flannel, blistering fermentations, and applications of
      hot and cold vinegar, until Whelks was nearly pickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the disappearance of his servant and Chewkle, Mr. Grahame returned to
      his guests with a smiling face and perfect serenity of manner, although
      every one in the room noticed his haggard aspect and the ghastly whiteness
      of his face. As he made no complaint, they were too well bred to make any
      remark, and, exerting himself to please, his pallid anxiousness passed
      without further observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Chewkle followed Whelks down stairs. The first twinges
      of pain were introducing themselves to Whelks&rsquo; notice. A sensation as if
      he was being repeatedly stabbed in the ear with a bradawl was the first
      intimation he had of something unpleasant coming on. He had a dim notion
      at the same time that Chewkle was addressing him as &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; but the
      lunges with the figurative brad-awl were so brisk when they once
      commenced, that he was plunged into the wildest confusion, being for the
      moment uncertain whether he was descending to the mat at the foot of the
      stairs upon his highly-floured locks, or upon his tight patent pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle, on reaching the hall, however, made him understand that he was
      anxious to get change for a ten-pound note, and wished to know where he
      could achieve it; Whelks, who was desirous of holding a little
      conversation with him, in hopes to worm something out of him, explanatory
      of the strange and anomalous influence he evidently possessed with the
      head of the household, offered to accommodate him, having, he said he
      believed, as much gold in his purse. He produced it, and displayed to the
      greedy eyes of Chewkle some eighteen or twenty sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Whelks counted out the gold, a storm of stabs set in on the inner
      portion of his ear, so that he grew embarrassed and handed a number of
      sovereigns to Chewkle, saying, as his eyes overran with water&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if they are right&mdash;ow! ow! ow! I&rsquo;ve the dreadfullest pangs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle counted eleven sovereigns, and said the amount was quite right. He
      handed the note to Whelks, and thrust the sovereigns into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was goin&rsquo; to say to you, sir,&rdquo; commenced Whelks, &ldquo;that I should like to
      have a &rsquo;arf-&rsquo;our&rsquo;s chat with you, if&mdash;ow! ow! ow! I never.
      Wheugh! oh, my hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad thing,&rdquo; said Chewkle, anxious to get off with the extra sovereign; &ldquo;I
      should &rsquo;ave it hout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave it hout?&rdquo; echoed Whelks, &ldquo;hits my hear, sir&mdash;ow! ow!
      ow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; responded Chewkle, inattentive to everything but getting away,
      &ldquo;&rsquo;ave it hout by all means&mdash;get it done for a bob. Good night,
      good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted through the doorway, as the porter threw open the door to admit
      a friend of his own, and made the best of his way to his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay awake, after getting to bed, for some time, busily plotting; and,
      before he dropped asleep, he made up his mind how he would act.
    </p>
    <p>
      By half-past eight in the morning, he appeared before the door of the
      offices of Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s solicitors. He knocked, and the laundress who was
      setting the clerk&rsquo;s office &ldquo;to rights,&rdquo; admitted him. He pretended to be
      surprised that no clerk was there, but on his stating that he had been
      sent, upon business of the utmost importance, by a client of the firm, and
      that he must not go back without an answer, the woman accommodated him
      with a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat motionless, but watched her movements closely. He observed her
      enter an inner apartment the consulting room of the principal. She
      remained in there some little time, and when she returned, he engaged her
      in conversation in a chatty, affable, familiar way, silently observing, at
      the same time, that she placed the key of the inner apartment in a
      particular spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she was summoned to make the breakfast of one of <i>her</i>
      clients, on another floor, and, telling Chewkle that the clerk would
      shortly arrive, she left him alone. He watched her, through the keyhole,
      ascend the stairs, then he heard a door above bang, and her foot
      reverberating overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the greatest possible quickness he made for the spot where the key
      was placed, and, securing it, unlocked the door of the inner apartment,
      and glided into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed sharply around at the boxes on the shelves, and upon one
      japanned, large and square, he saw printed in white letters, the name of
      Grahame, and beneath it the date of the year. He made for it, and opened
      it noiselessly. It was three parts full of papers. Upon the very top was
      the deed for which he had come thither. He recognised the endorsement, but
      he opened it, and at the bottom saw Wilton&rsquo;s signature as Grahame had
      written it. The sight of the name was sufficient. He carefully closed the
      box, retreated from the room, replaced the key where he had taken it from,
      put the deed beneath his waistcoat, and then buttoned his coat over that
      up to his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reseated himself in pretty much the same position as that he had taken
      when the laundress left him, and upon his face he wore a blank expression,
      leaving it a debateable point whether he was more stupid than innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock of a neighbouring church struck nine!
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten minutes afterwards the door opened, and a young man about two
      and twenty entered. He started on seeing Chewkle, and looked as
      disconcerted as a man who comes suddenly upon a creditor whom he cannot
      pay, the said creditor being inexorable and rapacious, and money his only
      pacificator. If such were the clerk&rsquo;s feelings, his apprehensions were
      relieved by Chewkle stating the object of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor won&rsquo;t be here till ten,&rdquo; replied the clerk; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t open his
      letters: and if I did I don&rsquo;t dare give up any papers. You must wait till
      he comes.&rdquo; He gave Chewkle back the letter and told him to take his seat
      again, which Chewkle did.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past nine Chewkle said, suddenly, that he wanted to make a call
      at no great distance off, and he thought he might as well go on that
      business as sit there doing nothing until ten, by which hour he could
      certainly be again at the office. The clerk said he thought so too. So
      Chewkle went leisurely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner out of sight of the office than he jumped into a cab, and drove
      to his own house, and in a secret place deposited in an iron chest, with
      other articles of value, the deed he had purloined. He locked the chest
      safely, and once more made his way to the street, where he hired another
      cab, rattled back to the neighbourhood of the lawyer&rsquo;s office, discharged
      it, and entered the office at three minutes to ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor not here yet,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle obeyed, looking vacant; laughing stupidly when the eye of the
      clerk caught his. &ldquo;What a pump,&rdquo; thought the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle felt slightly uneasy, for fear the managing clerk Scathe should
      make his appearance and recognise him, but he calculated he was engaged at
      Westminster, in a cause, and would be hunting up witnesses before he made
      his appearance at the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the thought passed through his mind, the door was flung open, and the
      principal of the firm entered. Chewkle rose up and handed him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mr. Grahame, Regent&rsquo;s Park,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the solicitor, with a smile. &ldquo;An answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray be seated. I will give you one immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk handed to his principal the key of his room; he took it,
      unlocked the door, and, passing in, closed it after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle sat and waited for the <i>dènouèment</i>, as if he was engaged
      counting the letters in the printed notices of sittings in term, stuck up
      over the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a bell rang, and the clerk entered the room, closing the door
      after him, Chewkle still reading the printed paper. Some time elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s happened, shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; muttered Chewkle, still staring
      at the printed bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the clerk made his appearance, and said o Chewkle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step in, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into the inner apartment, and Chewkle saw the solicitor
      with a flushed face and excited countenance, going through the papers in
      the box with the name of Grahame painted upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Chewkle, I believe,&rdquo; said the solicitor, as Chewkle
      approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name, and no other, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Hem! You were sent
      hither for a deed by Mr. Grahame&mdash;eh?&rdquo; inquired the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A deed, sir&mdash;why, he said &rsquo;twas to be a paper packet,&rdquo;
       returned Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. Do you know what the paper was about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, sir?&mdash;no, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor why Mr. Grahame is so anxious to have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, sir?&mdash;no, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&mdash;very odd&mdash;very remarkable, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Scathe must have got it, or put it somewhere,&rdquo; suggested the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can furnish no other solution of the mystery,&rdquo; answered the principal
      in the same tone. &ldquo;But if that is the case, Mr. Scathe is very much to
      blame, and will not fail, to be made acquainted with my opinion to that
      effect.&rdquo; Then raising his voice, he addressed Chewkle. &ldquo;Be good enough to
      tell Mr. Grahame that I will send the deed up to him by one of my clerks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me to say, sir, that he couldn&rsquo;t wait for that, so I was to bring
      it with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not wait for <i>that!</i> What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I s&rsquo;pose he thought you might be busy and would put off
      sending the packet to him until it suited your convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see&mdash;um! Well, deliver the message I have given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he said I warn&rsquo;t to go without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to Mr. Grahame, my man, and say I will send it up to&mdash;him&mdash;by&mdash;my&mdash;clerk!&rdquo;
       exclaimed the solicitor, speaking, under increasing irritation, with
      marked emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go back without it, sir, on no consideration,&rdquo; persisted Chewkle,
      assuming a dogged manner, &ldquo;them&rsquo;s my instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The solicitor looked fiercely at him, and raising his voice, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have it. I say&mdash;you&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;have it. It is not
      come-at-able at this moment! do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle quite understood that. It was certainly not come-at-able, unless
      some one picked the lock of his iron safe, but he appeared not to
      comprehend anything, except that he was ordered not to return without a
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolt!&rdquo; growled the solicitor, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and penned a note to Mr. Grahame, stating that his managing
      clerk&mdash;as the business was being pushed on&mdash;had the deed under
      his charge; he was at the moment down at Westminster engaged upon a cause,
      but that on his return the deed should be forwarded to Mr. Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding up his note, and directing it, he gave it to Chewkle, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deliver that to Mr. Grahame;&rdquo; turning sharply to his clerk, he added,
      &ldquo;Mr. Crumpler, show him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crumpler caught Chewkle by the coat sleeve, drew him into the outer
      office, and pointed significantly to &ldquo;the way out.&rdquo; Chewkle exhibited his
      teeth&mdash;no mistaking them for pearls&mdash;to Mr. Crumpler, and obeyed
      the sign. He descended the stairs rapidly, and moved along the footway of
      the street, quivering in the throes of what he considered an immense
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hincome for life,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that deed will be as good as a &rsquo;nuity
      to me. I can bleed Grahame of jest whatever I pleases by threatening of
      him. I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to let him know I&rsquo;ve got the forged hinstru-ment, but
      I shall, in good time, &rsquo;int as I knows where it is, and I can keep
      it dark, or blow it, jest whichever I likes. &lsquo;Find it and send it up,&rsquo; ha!
      ha! by Mr. Walker I s&rsquo;pose. They little thinks I nabbed it, none of &rsquo;em
      will ever dream o&rsquo; that&mdash;I could lay a &rsquo;undred to one about
      that, I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he offered to lay these very long odds, he ran up against Nathan Gomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visage of the little man shone like burnished gold. His eyes danced
      and sparkled, and he chuckled as if animated by the most pleasurable
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! friend Chewkle,&rdquo; he exclaimed, placing his cold, fishy hand upon
      Chewkle&rsquo;s fevered wrist; &ldquo;you are active this morning&mdash;full of
      business&mdash;away from home to a lawyer&rsquo;s office&mdash;then hurrying
      back in a cab to your charmingly retired abode&mdash;away in a cab back to
      the solicitors, and now, ha! ha! eh? I&rsquo;ll be sworn to Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s, in
      the Regent&rsquo;s Park, with <i>a</i> communication&mdash;I say <i>a</i>
      communication, he! he! Brisk fellow, sharp fellow, smart dog.&rdquo; He poked
      Chewkle in the ribs, and Chewkle felt as if the dent his finger made
      remained, and would continue a hole for the rest of his life. &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;
       continued Nathan, &ldquo;I am so partial to sharp fellows, especially when they
      move about so nimbly to serve others, without a thought of serving
      themselves, eh, friend Chewkle?&mdash;I say without one thought of doing
      themselves a small turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle tried to laugh, but no sound issued from his distended jaws. He
      felt his flesh crawl and creep over his bones, and his marrow vibrate; his
      scalp seemed to have the &ldquo;pins and needles,&rdquo; and his hair to rise slowly
      up, dust and all, threatening to tilt his hat into the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan grinned at him like a Hindoo idol, nodded, and, diving among the
      flowing stream of persons ceaselessly passing on, disappeared. Chewkle
      shuddered, and drew a long breath. &ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s the devil hisself,&rdquo; he
      groaned, and slowly&mdash;now doubtfully&mdash;pursued his way to
      Grahame&rsquo;s abode, made very uneasy by the conviction that the secret of his
      morning&rsquo;s performance was not exclusively confined to himself.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Hal Vivian and
      Flora Wilton, summoned by Nathan Gomer, rejoined old Wilton, prior to his
      departure from the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, they found him at the gate, leading into
      the ante-chamber or cage, through which every incomer or outgoer must
      pass, awaiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared, in the eyes of both Flora and Hal, to have become another
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was yet meanly clad, his face was still furrowed, and bore the lines of
      care and sorrow, and his hair straggled loosely and wildly; but there was
      a brilliancy in his eye, recently so dim; there was a hectic flush upon
      his cheek, of late wan and pallid; and his figure, some few hours past
      drooping, the symbol of hopeless wretchedness, was now erect, firm, and
      that of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the tone of his voice had undergone a change. It had been sharp,
      though weak and querulous&mdash;it was now round and clear, indicating a
      heart purified and emancipated from the destroying influences of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner, which had been that of a grateful and respectful recipient of
      services, now assumed the character of the power to confer them, not
      haughtily nor patronisingly, but gently and kindly, still marked by
      conscious elevation of position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden key, used by some, as yet unknown, good angel, had shot back
      the bolts of the prison to let Eustace Wilton pass into the free world
      beyond. The gatekeepers had an instinctive respect for a man who could pay
      two thousand pounds after so short a detention, so they cast away their
      brusque, sharp, extraofficial impertinence of manner, and obsequiously
      congratulated him upon his early departure. They expressed their full and
      decided conviction that he would not quit &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s Hotel&rdquo; without
      remembering those attached to the establishment, because, as the spokesman
      forcibly rather than elegantly observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the custom o&rsquo; gentlemen, as was gentlemen, to act as sech, and to
      behave accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilton had not forgotten the poor debtors&rsquo; box, and in the elation of his
      spirits, could not resist the appeal thus made to him. To the manifest
      astonishment of Hal Vivian, and to the marvel of Flora, he took from his
      purse two sovereigns, and handed them to the gatekeeper, who accepted the
      amount with a smile, which extended to the visages of two of his brother
      officers, who were at his elbow prepared to divide the gift as soon as
      Wilton&rsquo;s back was turned. Nathan Gomer witnessed the act with undisguised
      disgust, and muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghouls! They fatten on the flesh and blood of the destitute and the
      wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Wilton by the arm as he spoke, and hurried him through the cage to
      the entrance, where a cab was waiting to receive the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Nathan Gomer, after a brief private conference with Wilton, took his
      leave, and the cab departed for the residence of Mr. Harper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilton was compelled to proceed there; his own dwelling was now a heap of
      charred and blackened ruins; but he had no intention of staying beneath
      the roof of Mr. Harper one hour longer than was necessary. He was grateful
      in his acknowledgments to the good goldsmith and his wife. Once more he
      also assured Hal that the obligation he had conferred upon him by saving
      Flora from destruction, was one which he could never repay, and that he
      should consider himself bound in the future to perform for him any service
      within his power, when called upon by him to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days, old Wilton was constantly occupied abroad. His manner was
      peculiar and mysterious; he volunteered no explanations, and answered
      questions with, reserve. He never alluded to the circumstances of his
      sudden liberation from prison, nor was even Flora made by him acquainted
      with the means by which it had been effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the evening of the second day, he returned to Mr. Harper&rsquo;s residence,
      and laconically informed the old goldsmith that he had been successful in
      securing a furnished house; he proposed, therefore, at once to remove
      himself and his daughter thither, that they might no longer prove a burden
      to those who had so unexpectedly such an addition made to their numbers,
      but who had played the part of Samaritans so nobly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement was listened to with regret by at least one person
      present, but no objection could be interposed, and before the hour of
      midnight had arrived, Flora found herself wooing the coy embraces of
      slumber upon a down bed, in an elegantly furnished bed-chamber, one of a
      suite in a handsome villa mansion in the Regent&rsquo;s Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had parted with Hal quietly: neither had displayed emotion: what they
      felt was concealed from the eyes of all present. Their words were few, but
      each seemed to wish the other to understand that lightly to forget would
      not be possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some compensation to Hal for the rude shattering of the ideal
      fabric he had so blissfully reared, to receive from Mr. Wilton the
      assurance that the doors of his house would ever be open to him, that he
      had a right to enter whenever he pleased, and that he might, in fact, view
      it as a second home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The saviour of my child deserves no less at my hands,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hal Vivian encountered poor Lotte Clinton, he had therefore no
      hesitation in conveying her direct to the new residence of Flora Wilton.
      Flora had frequently inquired after her, and had hoped that she would
      visit her, for she had not forgotten her display of womanly sympathy when
      she was distracted by a combination of troubles, and she was anxious to
      express her grateful sense of Lotte&rsquo;s kindheartedness, and her hope that
      some day she might be able to repay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lotte came not. Flora imagined that her brother had conveyed her to
      some place of residence near his own, and though at times uneasy thoughts
      would rise and suggest that she might have escaped the horrors of the
      burning house only to fall into new dangers, still she hoped that she
      should see her again, smiling and cheerful, as she had been, and in a
      better position than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal knew this, and decided that he could not do better than conduct Lotte
      to her when he found her in a condition of despair and destitution which
      had given up all other hope of relief but what self-destruction would
      afford.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cab pursued its way, Lotte sat with her face buried in her hands,
      weeping. She wished to restrain the violence of her emotions&mdash;to
      attain a calmness which would enable her to speak to Hal with some degree
      of steadiness&mdash;but in vain; she had not power to resist the torrent&mdash;the
      floodgates were borne away, and she could only lean in the corner of the
      vehicle, and let her tears pursue their impetuous course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that new hopes were awakened, or that she doubted the result of
      her meeting with Hal. She knew instinctively it would lift her for the
      moment out of her despairing destitution, but it still rendered her future
      shadowy and undefined. She must accept pecuniary obligations from him. She
      shrank from them&mdash;needlessly enough&mdash;but her fears had by
      reflection been aroused, and her desperate situation had magnified them
      into unnatural proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, her thoughts were of a very uncertain, half-formed character;
      she was too prostrated to think much. She had, with a mind worked up to a
      pitch of frenzy, stood upon the verge of eternity&mdash;a moment more, and
      she had precipitated herself into the obscure and misty regions of that
      unmapped land. She had been suddenly held back to renew the battle of life&mdash;upon
      what terms was hidden from her, but the revulsion of feeling occasioned by
      this recall overmastered all faculties but that of weeping, and left her,
      as we have stated, absorbed in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal sought not to check them. It would be time enough to speak to her when
      the paroxysm had ceased, or at least abated somewhat of its violence. He
      hoped then for the return of better feelings; not that he intended to read
      her any homily upon the folly and the wickedness of the crime into the
      commission of which she was hurrying, because he believed that more
      powerful suggestions than any he could offer would present themselves to
      her, and because, also, from what little he knew of her nature, he felt
      fully convinced that the incitement to leap out of life into the dread
      unknown must have been of a description exceeding the sustaining powers of
      others gifted even with a higher capacity of endurance than she possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for a considerable distance, they rode on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her low-drawn sobs had grown gradually wider in the interval of their
      inspirations, and ultimately the painful sound ceased entirely. Having
      satisfied himself that she had not fainted, he made a few commonplace
      observations. Yet not altogether unconnected with the circumstances under
      which he had fallen in with her at a moment of such intense importance, in
      order to prove to her that it was a direct interposition of Providence in
      her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint monosyllable, uttered now and then, was all she returned in reply;
      for she felt her helpless position most acutely, however grateful she
      ought to have been for her rescue from an attempt to commit
      self-destruction, and she was glad when the cab stopped at the address
      which Hal had given to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having dismissed the vehicle, Hal led Lotte up the gravelled path leading
      to the door of Mr. Wilton&rsquo;s new residence, and gave a summons at the door
      with the hand of one who felt he had a right of <i>entree</i> in that
      house at any time. He was ushered into the hall promptly. It was his first
      visit. A glance told him the style in which Mr. Wilton&mdash;so recently a
      humble gold-worker to his uncle&rsquo;s establishment&mdash;had commenced to
      live. The hall-porter who opened the door turned his inquiring eyes upon
      the new comers, uncertain whether to be civil or calmly insulting to them.
      He had yet to learn the description of visitors whom his new master
      delighted to honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal, sensitive, and restive under suspicion as to his status in society,
      drew a card from his card-case, and in a very decided tone, which sounded
      like command, said, as he handed the small piece of thin pasteboard to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will please to say that I am desirous of seeing Miss Wilton, and that
      I shall esteem it a favour if she will grant me an interview at once and
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall-porter instantly summoned a man-servant, dressed in a livery of
      deep violet hue, and gave him the card and the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely a minute elapsed ere the man reappeared, and bade him follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal pressed the arm of Lotte as he felt her cower by his side, overwhelmed
      by what her dim eyes beheld, and he led her gently in the direction the
      man had taken. She tottered, and could hardly find strength to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage! courage! Lotte, my good girl: my life for it, you will be
      tenderly received,&rdquo; he whispered gently to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! she was grateful to him for those encouraging words. But all this
      grandeur! She could have met Flora readily, if she were as she had until
      now known her, but to come before her&mdash;so hapless a wretch as she
      deemed herself to be&mdash;in the midst of all this luxury and wealth, was
      only a new trial. She said not a word, but she feared her reception; to be
      pitied and to be patronised now would be to slay her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man ushered them into a small but elegantly furnished apartment: a
      lamp burned brightly upon the table. Near to it stood Flora Wilton,
      dressed as Hal had never seen her before. Her attire was such as a
      princess might have worn&mdash;and with pride, for it was costly in its
      value, and in its taste unimpeachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the light fell full upon her face and form, Hal turned faint. Flora
      smiled sweetly, and said in a tone musical, half joyous, yet half
      reproachful&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to see you, Hal!&mdash;Mr. Vivian&mdash;I&mdash;I thought
      you would have come before; I quite ex&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, for she suddenly perceived Lotte, who had tremblingly shrunk
      behind Hal, wishing from the depths of her aching heart she had never,
      never been induced to come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal followed the direction of her eyes, and he said, hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grateful, Miss Wilton, for your kind reception, but to-night, at
      least, I do not claim it for myself. I have one poor sorrowful heart here
      with me for whom I entreat your warm interest; she needs it. To ensure
      your sympathy, I may only suggest that Lotte Clinton&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was at the side of Lotte in an instant, with her arm round her
      waist. The bright rays of the lamp fell upon the thin, white, wasted
      features of the poor, half-fainting creature. Flora had last seen her a
      roundfaced, pretty, lively, laughing girl. What a dreadful change did she
      now behold!
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She twined her arms about Lotte&rsquo;s shoulders; she laid her cold wan face
      upon her own warm bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lotte, Lotte, dear, dear Lotte, what has happened?&rdquo; she murmured,
      through her streaming tears; &ldquo;why are are you so dreadfully changed?
      Confide in me as in a sister&mdash;pray, pray do; oh, my heart aches to
      see you thus; indeed, Lotte, it does; in very truth, it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why, had Flora been grand, had she played the lady, had she offered to
      take the case presented to her by Hal at an early moment, and promised to
      do something, Lotte might have been pierced to the heart&mdash;but she
      would then have stood up bravely and haughtily&mdash;have declined the
      intended favour, though she consigned herself to destitution by the act;
      but to be caught thus to Flora&rsquo;s heart&mdash;to be embraced&mdash;to have
      poured into her ears expressions of tender sympathy&mdash;to feel upon her
      cheeks the tears of human pity, which had the essence of divine pity&mdash;to
      feel, to be convinced that the tender commiseration which Flora&mdash;though
      unknowing the circumstances&mdash;had exhibited for her was sincere&mdash;it
      was all&mdash;all!&mdash;more than she could bear; she sank at Flora&rsquo;s
      feet, embraced her knees, tried to ejaculate her gratefulness, tried to
      tell that now, indeed, she felt herself lifted out of despair and
      degradation; but exhausted nature refused to do more, and she fell back
      upon the carpet in a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal, who had walked to the end of the apartment, half choked in his
      efforts to repress the tears which would flow into his eyes, now, at a
      sudden cry from the lips of Flora, rushed forward, and raised Lotte from
      the ground, while Flora rang the bell, which brought into the apartment
      her maid&mdash;a young, but strong, good looking, and seemingly
      good-humoured girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora beckoned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me to bear this young lady into my dressing-room,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;she
      has fainted; be very gentle and tender in your movements, Mercy, for she
      is very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear young lady,&rdquo; said the girl, gazing upon Lotte&rsquo;s ghastly
      features. &ldquo;She do look bad, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She received her from Hal&rsquo;s custody, and lifting her up in her arms as if
      she had been a child, she bore her tenderly to Flora&rsquo;s chamber, and laid
      her gently on the bed. As Flora was following, Hal detained her, and in a
      few brief words, acquainted her with the circumstances which had attended
      his meeting with Lotte; he left her to obtain the rest from her own
      surmises, or from any communications Lotte might make, and he took the
      opportunity of bidding her farewell, promising that he would pay a more
      formal visit, and make a more protracted stay, within a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fail,&rdquo; said Flora with some earnestness, &ldquo;for my father is very
      anxious to see you here; he has made many inquiries respecting you, and I&mdash;I&mdash;do
      hope you will come soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She need have been under no apprehension that he would stay away. Her
      beauty was a magnet which would have drawn visitors loving her far less
      passionately than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way home, defiantly challenging the ideal to produce such
      exquisite and perfect loveliness as the real had that night presented to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora hurried to her chamber, where poor Lotte yet lay senseless. She was
      too ill that night to leave her bed. She was placed under the careful
      skill of an eminent physician, who at once declared her illness to be
      occasioned solely by mental distress, and treated her accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may here mention that Mrs. Bantom grew very uneasy when nine o&rsquo;clock
      came and Lotte had not come back, and by ten Mr. &ldquo;Jeems&rdquo; Bantom was
      dispatched in search of her, with strong injunctions not to go about his
      task as if he was anxious to give her into the custody of the police on a
      charge of petty larceny, or to act in such a way as to induce persons to
      believe that he was on the prowl with the view of dishonestly possessing
      himself of property which &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t his&rsquo;n,&rdquo; but to proceed at once, and make
      his inquiries in a clear and straightforward manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeems&rdquo; Bantom fortunately possessed the address of the knave for whom
      Lotte had worked without obtaining her earnings, and he went there direct.
      He quickly found that the place was shut up, and that the proprietor had
      &ldquo;bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gal&rsquo;s been done out of her wages,&rdquo; he said, to himself, &ldquo;and is
      afeard to come back. She&rsquo;s a hiding of herself somewheres, an&rsquo; I must find
      her, else she&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; and doin&rsquo; somethen foolish. I&rsquo;d keep that gal
      jes&rsquo; the same as I would one of my own kids, rather than any harm should
      come to her&mdash;that I would; &rsquo;cos I&rsquo;m sure she is honest,
      straightfor&rsquo;ard, and hard-working. Ah! I&rsquo;m blessed if ever I saw anyone,
      woman or man, work so hard as she did over them faddle-daddies wimmen will
      have, without carin&rsquo; a farden how many of their own blessed sort they
      kills in the makin&rsquo; on &lsquo;em. I jes&rsquo; wish I could get hold o&rsquo; that cove that
      got the poor gal to do all that work, and then hooked it. I&rsquo;d jes&rsquo; scrag
      him. I&rsquo;d make a korps on him, or my name ain&rsquo;t Jem Bantom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chances are that if Mr. Bantom had fallen in with him, at the moment,
      he would have kept his word, or at least have so severely trounced him
      that his most intimate friends would, for a lengthened period, have been
      unable to recognise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bantom was checked at the very place where he expected to obtain
      information. None of the persons living near to the house where Lotte had
      called for her money had seen her, and he had to start off to find a clue
      to her as best he could. He inquired at police-stations, at hospitals, and
      at cab-ranks, but without gaining any tidings of her; and the night had
      worn away when he returned to report his ill success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bantom wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor young lonesome thing &rsquo;as drownded herself,&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;all along o&rsquo; the cussed money she told me she owed us. She said she
      would!&mdash;she said she would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Bantom sobbed bitterly as she uttered the last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bantom looked upon Lotte very much as he would upon a dog which he had
      picked up, brought home, found to possess good qualities, and had grown
      into a pet. He had found and brought Lotte home, and he felt a personal
      interest in her, which could not have been created in his breast under any
      other circumstances. When, therefore, he heard his wife&rsquo;s surmise, he
      seized his hat, put it on his head, and, tired as he was, prepared to
      sally forth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah&rdquo; he said, in a husky tone, &ldquo;I likes to know the wust, I does&mdash;I
      purfers it. I&rsquo;m off to the river, I am, jes&rsquo; to show you you&rsquo;re wrong.
      Keep up your pluck, old gal, I&rsquo;ll be back as quick as ever I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went; traversed both sides of the river between London and Westminster
      bridges, and crawled home in the morning exhausted, as the clock was
      striking seven. He threw himself into a chair despondent as ever man in
      this world was, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, Keziah, you wus wrong; nobody has drownded themselves this
      blessed night. I&rsquo;ve been both sides of the river, from Billin&rsquo;sgate to
      Lambeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud knock at this instant was given at the street-door. Mr. and Mrs.
      Bantom came into collision at the lock, and both pulled at it together. It
      was not Lotte who had knocked, and their countenances fell, for, with
      hearts beating high with hope, they had fully persuaded themselves she had
      come &ldquo;home&rdquo; at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footman in violet livery met their gaze instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at husband and wife, and, with the air and manner of a cabinet
      minister in his court dress, he said, inquiringly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bantom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; exclaimed husband and wife together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman produced a letter, and handed it to Bantom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bantom could read, but not with ease and rapidity; he could write,
      too, but his hand was bold and slightly irregular. He was very nervous
      this morning and the handwriting of the superscription was so delicate a
      fairy might have penned it. He looked at his wife, opened the envelope,
      and took out a sheet of delicate note paper, which he unclosed. It
      contained a Bank of England note, which, with trembling fingers, Bantom
      spread wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fi&rsquo;pun note, &rsquo;ep my goodness!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with astonishment.
      He mechanically handed the paper which had contained the note to the
      footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You looks like a good scholard,&rdquo; he observed;&ldquo;&rsquo;jes&rsquo; read that
      pretty writing for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footman, with a supercilious smile, not sorry to be put in possession
      of the contents of the note, read asfollows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lotte sends her &ldquo;kindest love to Mr. and Mrs. Bantom, and begs them to
      forgive her for any uneasiness she may have occasioned them. She desires
      to assure them that though ill, she is quite safe.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-hah-ha-ah!&mdash;ah-a-hah-a!&rdquo; burst from Bantom&rsquo;s lips, sounds composed
      of hysterical laughter, and a genuine cry, although the latter was the
      offspring of joy alone. Mrs. Bantom flung her apron over her head, that
      the tears she shed might not be visible to the strange young man in
      violet. She had small need to be ashamed of the honest tears of happiness
      at the communication thus received of Lotte&rsquo;s safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman was rather indignant at this interruption, he saw nothing as
      he said to &ldquo;&rsquo;owl at,&rdquo; and he requested them to be quiet while he
      read the remaining&rsquo; contents of the note. They obeyed him, an occasional
      sigh and sniff from Mrs. Bantom being the only further interruption. The
      note went on to say that Lotte would see them shortly, but in part payment
      of what she was indebted to them, she inclosed the note, hoping they would
      believe she would never forget their kindness to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was joy in Bantom&rsquo;s house that day. His shop was better stocked than
      usual, and many of the very poor were allowed to have credit, which, under
      ordinary circumstances, Bantom could not have afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte, on being recovered from her swoon, though very feeble and under
      strong injunctions not to speak, could not rest until she had unfolded her
      true condition to Flora, and begged her to let the Bantoms, at least know
      that she was safe; that her mysterious absence, as nearly as possible,
      might be accounted for. We have seen in what manner Flora complied with
      her wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days and the tender care and kindness of Flora Wilton were rewarded
      by the rapidly returning strength of Lotte. She was able to leave her room
      and to walk in the garden with Flora. These walks in the soft fresh air
      did much to revive her; the garden was so prettily laid out, the flowers
      so profuse and beautiful&mdash;she loved flowers passionately&mdash;that
      it afforded her considerable pleasure to stroll there in company with her
      kind friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, while most grateful for the affectionate sympathy and generosity
      of Flora, she had no notion of remaining dependant. She had far too brave
      a spirit for that, and she felt that these daily walks among the flowers
      in the bright clear air were bringing back to her health and strength, to
      renew the labour of breadwinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One lovely morning, while strolling with Flora, she said to her lightly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The garden adjoining this appears to be extremely beautiful, although it
      is hardly possible to get a glimpse at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have discovered already the mysteries of this garden, Lotte. There are
      several little secret nooks, of which you would never dream, if you had
      not searched them out. I will take you to one where you can have an
      unimpeded view of the next garden, and you will say when you see it that
      it is beautiful indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora at once turned from the path into a narrow alcove of young alder and
      beech trees, and Lotte followed her. They pursued a winding course for a
      short distance, and were stopped by a wire fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adjoining garden lay spread out before them in all its cultivated
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But also before them, face to face, within five or six feet, were a party
      of ladies and gentlemen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gwacious, Vane,&rdquo; exclaimed suddenly a tall, bulky, fair young man,
      &ldquo;did you evaw in youaw wemembwance see an angel&rsquo;s face so wavishingly
      beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the whole party were turned at once upon Flora Wilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely, indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated Lester Vane, for he, with Helen, Margaret,
      and Evangeline Grahame, were of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen Grahame turned her large dark eyes upon Flora. It was impossible not
      to acknowledge the extreme loveliness of the fair young face upon which
      her gaze rested, but a pang of mortification and jealousy penetrated her
      bosom, for Vane&rsquo;s words rang in her ears, and a glance told her that his
      eyes were riveted upon Flora&rsquo;s face with an expression of passionate
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene lasted but a moment. Flora, abashed and almost terrified, shrank
      back and hurried away, closely followed by Lotte, who felt like being
      detected in a somewhat mean act of espionage, though in this she was not
      just to herself or to her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day and night Lester Vane could not forget the face he had
      momentarily seen. It was before him in the flowers, in the fleecy clouds,
      in the waters of the fountain, in the shadows of the night. When his eyes
      in thoughtfulness closed, it was like a star in the misty gloom. Turn
      which way he would, direct his thoughts to any channel, still the face
      floated before his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was that young and lovely creature&mdash;what her name, condition,
      character?
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to ascertain as quickly as he could. He knew that he should
      be restless and unhappy until he had acquired this information at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he conceived a sudden absorbing passion for her? Was this love at
      first sight?

    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Grahame entered
      his library, on the morning following his interview with Chewkle, at least
      an hour before the time appointed for the return of that individual, with
      the deed which he had promised to obtain, and of which he had possessed
      himself&mdash;to use as an instrument of extortion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound in the library, save the ticking of the valuable and
      exquisitely finished specimen of handicraft, the skeleton timepiece, upon
      the broad marble mantel-shelf, for Mr. Grahame sat with hands clasped
      before him, plunged in profound, and uneasy thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though a death-like stillness pervaded the apartment, there was a
      terrible storm raging within his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s position was perilous and critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      On attaining his majority, he had inherited landed property, from which he
      derived an income of nearly ten thousand a year, and personal property to
      the value of thirty thousand pounds. He married a near relative of a
      Scotch Duke, also a Grahame, and kin of many of the proudest&mdash;if
      poorest&mdash;families in Scotland. With her he had a dowry of ten
      thousand pounds; and thus he may be said to have commenced his married
      life in a station of affluence, and with the brightest prospects of
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had, during his minority, been brought up in parsimonious
      seclusion. Like the majority of his race, he was burdened with an arrogant
      pride&mdash;a pride that would eat toasted herrings and potatoes in state,
      that would look down in ineffable scorn upon the tradesmen it was too poor
      to pay&mdash;a pride that was essentially inflation, and wholly devoid of
      true dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When approaching manhood, provided with the narrowest allowance, he had
      preferred to be chiefly in the glen or on the mountain, where but little
      money was needed, to mixing with the gay world into which his narrow
      stipend would have introduced him&mdash;slightly above the condition of a
      beggar. And thus he passed his minority away, yearning for the death of
      his miserly father, who scraped, and saved, and accumulated, without a
      thought crossing him that some day the mean and acquisitive spirit which
      inhabited his frame would take its flight suddenly to the unknown land;
      and, with the old and withered trunk it had inhabited, leave all the
      savings, and dirty hoardings and scrapings behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it turned out. One morning old Grahame was found at the threshold of
      his bed-room door&mdash;a stiff, stark, grinning corpse&mdash;and
      Claverhouse Grahame was declared the inheritor of ten thousand a year, and
      thirty thousand pounds besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this, he encountered Margaret Grahame. As she was
      marriageable, and had ten thousand pounds by way of dowry, he proposed for
      her hand. How could she refuse ten thousand a year? The possibility of
      liking Claverhouse Grahame never entered her imagination. She took him as
      part of the fortune&mdash;rather because she could not have the fortune
      without him, and because the married state was not altogether complete
      without a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of love, in its purity and holiness, she had no conception. She considered
      her father and mother as grand and dignified persons, entitled to filial
      respect and deference from her. She was passionately fond of state, and
      pomp, and display, of jewels, of dress, of genealogy&mdash;whatever
      pertained to an elevated position; but an emotion purely disinterested,
      one equal to a self-sacrifice, she never possessed. She gave her hand to
      Grahame, because the act brought her ten thousand a year. Her heart was
      only so far involved in the transaction that it vibrated with pleasure at
      the prospect of the situation in which such an income would place her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a natural consequence of Grahame&rsquo;s probation, and his wife&rsquo;s
      immeasurable pride&mdash;a pride which, like his, had been confined by the
      economical style of living adopted by her parents, to enable them to give
      such a wedding portion with her as he had received&mdash;that his
      imagination should convert the capabilities of ten thousand a year into
      those of five times the amount, and that, by the same process of mental
      exaggeration, his forty thousand pounds, should appear inexhaustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to live as though his income possessed an elasticity which
      enabled it to stretch to any length, and was startled, at the end of some
      few years, to find that his forty thousand pounds had not only evaporated,
      but that his liabilities more than exceeded three years&rsquo; income. He was
      too proud to make his wife acquainted with this unpleasant state of his
      affairs, because it would necessitate suggestions of retrenchment. Now she
      had formed so large an estimate of her dowry, that he was quite aware she
      would taunt him with having unjustifiably made away with it, although she
      had herself spent every shilling of it, and a large sum in addition, in
      the indulgence of her overweening pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would too, he knew, hurl upon him expressions of contempt, for having
      inveigled her with so splendid a jointure, from her castle home in the
      Highlands&mdash;where a great deal of dirty state was maintained at a
      small cost&mdash;only to subject her to the degradation of being
      compelled, when she formed a wish suggested for the gratification of her
      darling pride, to take the means of accomplishing it into consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore said not a word to her, and went on as before, save that he
      looked more closely into his own affairs, raised his rents where possible
      to the highest limits, forgave no tenant, on any plea, arrears, and
      squeezed all he could out of renewals of leases. Hard, uncompromising,
      refusing to spend a shilling on his land, he was hated by the whole
      tenantry, and when, to gratify the stately dreams of his wife, he paid an
      annual visit to the castle, his tenants, one and all uttered reluctantly
      the hurrahs which, under the dark threats of the steward, they gave to
      greet his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his efforts, he found it impossible to pay off his
      liabilities, and make his income support the style in which he lived. What
      he contrived to save, his wife expended, growing, as her family increased
      in years, more arrogantly proud than ever. It was not that she lavished or
      squandered money, but her tastes were enormously expensive. She bought as
      an empress, preferring to give many hundreds for rare objects rather than
      single pounds for articles equally handsome, but more common; and it was
      these heavy drains upon his resources which kept Mr. Grahame in a
      perpetual state of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length many of his debts assumed a pressing character; he shrank from
      appearing in a tradesman&rsquo;s eyes deficient in funds, and, to obtain ready
      cash, a first mortgage on a portion of his property was executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within the vortex, rescue by the aid of his remaining property,
      without the most rigid curtailment of every unnecessary expense, was
      utterly hopeless, and at the moment of his forging Wilton&rsquo;s name to the
      deed which Chewkle had that morning stolen, a few thousand pounds at his
      bankers was all he possessed to meet heavy engagements, and all the
      future, for every acre of his lands was in the possession of a mortgagee.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, an enormous property to which he preferred a claim by
      right of descent. It was disputed, and in Chancery; the claimants had been
      many, but they had dwindled down by death to two&mdash;himself and Eustace
      Wilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years back, during the lifetime of the owner of the property, Wilton had
      lived upon a portion of the estate&mdash;a slice of considerable
      dimensions, and held under a simple document&mdash;a deed of gift, though
      not drawn up by a lawyer. The original owner died suddenly, and, as it was
      believed, intestate. As he died without issue, and no will could be found,
      a host of claimants sprang up, and the estate went into Chancery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Wilton was called upon to prove his claim to the estate he held, and
      to improve which he had expended every sixpence of the fortune he had
      possessed independent of it. He produced his document. So far as the
      wording of the instrument went, it had full legal force; but proof was
      needed that it was in the actual handwriting of the deceased, and that it
      was in all respects executed by him in favour of Wilton&mdash;given
      freely, fairly, without coercion, and with the full intention that Wilton
      should enjoy, have, and hold possession of the estate thus presented to
      him for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been witnessed, but the witness was gone away, no one knew where.
      The handwriting of the document was questioned, and on the trial to prove
      Wilton&rsquo;s title to the estate, the weight of evidence for and against its
      being genuine was divided&mdash;if it did preponderate, it was rather
      against than for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge held the non-production of the witness to be fatal to the claim,
      and a verdict was so given. The property was therefore wrested from
      Wilton; he was turned homeless into the world, with his wife and family,
      while the estate itself was joined to the other property, and the whole
      income went into the hands of the receiver appointed by the Court&mdash;to
      be held in trust, disgorged only when a claimant appeared, who could prove
      his title to inherit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the claim to the property as a whole, Wilton was the nearest of kin,
      but here again he was debarred for want of a witness, who was believed to
      be living, but who could not be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grahame&rsquo;s chain of evidence in support of his claim was unbroken, and his
      title to the property indisputable if Wilton were out of the way. The only
      thing which debarred Wilton&rsquo;s obtaining the estates was a doubt thrown
      upon the validity of his mother&rsquo;s marriage. Grahame knew that, and, so far
      as it went, it was enough to keep him out of possession. But if Wilton
      signed a paper waiving all claim to the property, which was at his finger
      tips, without the power to grasp it, Grahame would, as the only other
      surviving claimant become entitled to it, and would obtain it; for, as we
      have said, his chain of evidence proving his right to it, next of kin
      failing, was complete in all its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may now be understood how immensely important it was to him to obtain
      Wilton&rsquo;s signature to a deed which he had had most carefully drawn up, and
      we have seen the lengths to which he went to obtain it. It may also be
      understood wherefore Wilton preferred imprisonment, under the strong hope
      that his much-wanted witness would some day appear, rather than sign a
      deed which excluded not only himself but his family from the possession of
      wealth, which was in truth and justice, though not to the satisfaction of
      the law, actually theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grahame pondered over the past down to the present despairing moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was now to be done? With the payment of the two bonds given by Wilton
      while trying his right to possess that which had been given him, he had
      lost all power by pressure over him: and destitution, perhaps
      imprisonment, stared him in the face&mdash;no, not imprisonment&mdash;no,
      not that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened a drawer, and took out a case, which, with a furtive glance
      round the chamber, he opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained within a beautifully-finished pair of pistols. He took one
      out, and examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is loaded,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and in good order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replaced it in the velvet compartment made to receive it, and returned
      the case to the drawer, which he closed and locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are there when needful,&rdquo; he said, between his clenched teeth. &ldquo;A
      Grahame knows how to die, but not to endure the degradation of poverty and
      ignominy. I will never die a pauper&rsquo;s death!&rdquo; he added, with a fearful
      oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his hands over his burning forehead, and racked his brain to
      find a path by which he could conquer his difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That usurious wretch, Gomer, has promised me funds upon the very document
      which before this he must know will not be completed,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What
      is to be done? What if I persist in affirming that the signature has been
      given, and act upon the man Chewkle&rsquo;s advice, suborn the men he named, and
      boldly claim the whole property? It is an enormous prize, and worth the
      risk. I can pay the villains well to hold their tongues until I am fairly
      in possession, and then&mdash;then&mdash;who knows&mdash;at some carouse
      at which <i>all</i> are assembled to celebrate their success&mdash;something
      in their drink may make them sleep&mdash;sleep to the day of doom. I do
      not like the man, Chewkle; the scoundrel is beginning to grow insultingly
      familiar, and will, I foresee, ere long assume a mastery over me. I must
      specially direct my attention to his permanent welfare. When, by his aid,
      my scheme is consummated, then&mdash;then if he escapes what I shall
      prepare for him, his good fortune will be a marvel&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chewkle, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed a servant, suddenly throwing open the
      library door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s heart leaped within him, and it palpitated painfully, but he
      exhibited his accustomed cold <i>hauteur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle entered with the air of a chap-fallen, disappointed man. His
      manner presented a strong contrast to the half-drunken, offensive, easy
      indifference it had displayed the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame detected it instantly; he replied to Chewkle&rsquo;s bow by an
      inclination of the head, and pointed to a chair upon the edge of which Mr.
      Chewkle gently sank, poising himself when there with the skill of a
      performer on the tight rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have obtained the deed, Chewkle,&rdquo; said Mr. Grahame&mdash;&ldquo;that of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no sir,&rdquo; returned Chewkle, &ldquo;not quite. I entertained &rsquo;igh,
      very &rsquo;igh hopes, but they has been chucked down into the deeps of
      the greatest disappointment. Them lawyers, sir&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&mdash;they did not refuse to give it to you?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Grahame, hastily and sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, not quite that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest it&mdash;where is it, sir? That&rsquo;s jest what I should like to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame, springing to his feet with a
      countenance of alarm. &ldquo;You do not mean to say it has been stolen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; cried Chewkle, leaping up with a face suddenly of the hue of
      scarlet. &ldquo;That would be too good a joke, too. Who&rsquo;d prig such a thing as
      that, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself, man! You are speaking in enigmas!&rdquo; cried Mr. Grahame,
      excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle drew from out of a dirty piece of light brown paper&mdash;which
      had been employed in the task of enclosing half-a-pound of &ldquo;moist&rdquo; sugar&mdash;the
      letter he received from the solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame snatched it from him, and tore it open. He read the contents
      twice, and then sat down and reflected for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing, Chewkle,&rdquo; he said, more composedly, &ldquo;that I perceive in
      this communication to occasion alarm: the deed will be sent here to day by
      one of the clerks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hopes it may,&rdquo; observed Chewkle, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime, my good friend,&rdquo; said Grahame, assuming a bland tone, &ldquo;I
      have been pondering over the situation, and I am afraid we have gone a
      little too far to pause now, or to retrace our steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We,&rdquo; echoed Chewkle, opening his eyes widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Mr. Grahame; &ldquo;if I stand in the position of a principal
      in the affair, you take the part of an accessory before the fact, and a
      very important one you are, too, inasmuch as you counselled the deed, and
      instructed me how to perform it, lending your assistance throughout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle would have here interposed some very emphatic observations,
      but that Mr. Grahame checked him, and continued speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my intention,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or my wish that the conversation
      should assume its present tone. I would rather that it took a shape which,
      while it consulted my interest, gave liberal promise of rich advantages to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle pricked up his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, if you remember,&rdquo; said Mr. Grahame, slowly fixing his eye
      firmly upon that of his &lsquo;agent,&rsquo; &ldquo;you threw out several suggestions
      calculated to afford me, in the distress of mind under which I was
      labouring, a very considerable degree of consolation. Do you remember
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle caught hold of his dusty, shaggy whiskers at the roots, and drew
      them out to their full extent with the tips of his fingers and thumb
      several times, to appear the unconscious act of a man plunged in
      reflection. Presently he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t altogether certain as I does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame now repeated the plan which he had the previous evening
      proposed to accomplish by the aid of Mr. Jukes and his companions, by
      which, in spite of all Wilton&rsquo;s protestations and oaths to the contrary,
      the signature was to be sworn to as being <i>bona fide</i> and genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewkle listened in silence, and when Mr. Grahame concluded by observing
      that he had almost decided upon adopting it, Mr. Chewkle felt himself to
      be unpleasantly situated upon the horns of a dilemma. Mr. Grahame had been
      candid enough to acknowledge that, unless he obtained the estate, he would
      be lost, destroyed, unable to reward the services of any person; but that
      if he, by the assistance of &ldquo;zealous friends,&rdquo; succeeded in securing it,
      the most magnificent recompense should be bestowed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle&rsquo;s difficulty consisted in having possession of the deed. If he
      retained it, it seemed that Mr. Grahame would be reduced to poverty, and
      his <i>exposé</i> of the guilty act of forgery would bring him nothing,
      perhaps, but the questionable advantage of being brought under the anxious
      consideration of a judge and jury, as a <i>particeps criminis</i>. If he
      gave it up to Mr. Grahame, he would have to account for its possession, an
      acknowledgment of the truth would place him at once in the power of Mr.
      Grahame, who could give him, if he pleased, into the custody of the police
      as a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, certainly, no middle course to steer, save waiting for a little
      while, to see what direction matters would take. He reflected that it
      would be wise not to be precipitate, but that it would be best to
      carefully consider whether there was a safe way to hit upon, which would
      conduct him out of his perplexing position. He began to fear he had been
      too hasty in securing the deed. The possession now seemed to be by no
      means so valuable to him, as it had done, when he locked it up carefully
      in his iron safe. The figure of Nathan Gomer kept dancing before his eyes,
      too, in the most disagreeable fashion&mdash;it was embarrassingly
      suggestive, and it disturbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame awaited his opinion upon the adoption of the desperate course
      with impatience, and at length said, hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you silent? Does the intention to carry out your own suggestion
      startle and terrify you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is not that; but swearing point blank in a court of
      law that a signature to a deed was written by a man whose hand never went
      near it, and in the teeth of his oath to the contrary, ain&rsquo;t altogether to
      be done without a good deal o&rsquo; consideration and arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think it will be the best plan to wait until you have
      got the deed back in your own hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;wherefore? It is in the custody of my solicitor&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure about that,&rdquo; suggested Chewkle, artfully but
      uncomfortably. &ldquo;He could not find it this morning&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! His managing clerk has it safe enough; he will proceed by the proper
      legal course to claim the estate which this waiver of Wilton&rsquo;s at once
      will put me in possession of. Of course Wilton will dispute it. We shall
      swear he signed to be released from the judgments we held against him,
      prove his signature on oath, I obtain the estate, and you and your friends
      a rich reward. Therefore, having finally resolved to pursue this plan, the
      deed cannot be better placed than where it is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chewkle shook his head. He had rather the deed had been anywhere but
      where it now was. He, however, interposed no further objection, but
      suggested that he should pay a visit to Messrs. Jukes and Nutty to sound
      them upon the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir, this plan makes us commit perjury as well as forgery,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, laying such emphasis on the two crimes, that Mr. Grahame
      started, and involuntarily shuddered. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it is not
      every man who has the pluck to take a false oath and stick to it&mdash;stick
      to it, that&rsquo;s the rub, sir. Taking a false oath ain&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s when
      the counsel begins to badger you, and to ask you this question and that,
      sometimes about the subjeck, and sometimes about things as has nothen to
      do with it, and then comes slap back to the subjeck again, so as to jerk a
      contradictory confession out on you; it&rsquo;s that as tries you. I ain&rsquo;t got
      much doubt about Jukes; he can stand any amount o&rsquo; cross-examining, he
      can, but it&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other I ain&rsquo;t certain about. However, I will go onto &rsquo;em
      at once, sound &rsquo;em cautiously without using any names&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; observed Mr. Grahame, approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they agrees, I will come to terms with them; and if they don&rsquo;t,
      sir&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get some one else,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewikle passed his hand over his chin. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that is, if
      they are to be got.&rdquo; Very few words more were interchanged between them
      ere Mr. Chewkle quitted the house, cursing the deed which he had with such
      an exercise of cunning purloined, and which would require so much
      ingenuity to restore, and leave him unsuspected of the theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Perjury and Forgery!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, as soon as he knew
      himself to be alone. &ldquo;This is hastening on in the career of crime. What if
      some voice were to howl in the ear of Mistress Grahame that her husband
      was a perjurer and a forger! A Grahame, one of the race that has prided
      itself upon never having cowered under the taint of dishonour&mdash;a
      wretched criminal&mdash;liable to be dragged, with all the horrors of the
      lowest degradation, to the bar of justice, thence to work out in chains a
      fearful servitude, in the company of wretches the most desperate. Into
      what a frightful, position has my pecuniary embarrassment hurled me?
      Henceforth I shall live in perpetual horror of discovery, of being called
      upon at any moment to face an officer to&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud, single knock at the library door at this moment made his heart
      leap into his mouth, and nearly caused him to scream with fright, but that
      his voice forsook him. Before he could recover sufficiently to accord
      permission to enter, Nathan Gomer walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale and haggard, Mr. Grahame regarded him with any other feeling than
      that of complacency. Nathan Gomer held mortgages on his property, and had
      advanced money on a bond; the day of payment named in it was fast
      approaching. He had also promised, upon certain security, to furnish
      additional funds. Mr. Grahame could only look upon him with the eyes of
      one deeply indebted to him; he believed that he would realise some portion
      of the sums he had loaned, but he knew that if fate proved adverse to him,
      Nathan would lose largely as well. He both hated and feared him, and he
      viewed his presence now with distrust. He anticipated that he was the
      harbinger of bad news: everything had gone so wrong of late, there was
      nothing else to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Gomer turned up his shining yellow visage, and grinned. How Grahame
      loathed that grin!&mdash;it seemed to betoken only mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He motioned to Nathan to take a chair, and, in a husky voice, begged to be
      informed what fortunate circumstance it was to which he was indebted for
      the felicity his presence thus unannounced, afforded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A matter I apprehend of no small importance to you, Mr. Grahame,&rdquo; replied
      Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame gulped. No doubt it was of importance to him; he expected that&mdash;most
      painful importance. What else could it be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am prepared,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for anything you may have to
      communicate to me, whatever distressing features it may possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Nathan. &ldquo;Hearken: you have a new neighbour next door
      to you;&rdquo; he pointed as he spoke, and asked&mdash;&ldquo;Do you know his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame looked at him with some surprise. What did such a question
      portend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan only grinned, and Mr. Grahame answered coldly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not accustomed to take any notice of my neighbours, or trouble
      myself to make inquiries respecting them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have been interested if you had, in the present instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated Grahame, a curl turning his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! His name is Wilton&mdash;Eustace Wilton&mdash;ah, you are interested
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame clutched Nathan by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;the wretched man dying inch by inch in his poverty&mdash;a
      day or so back in the Queen&rsquo;s Prison, and now&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your next door neighbour, with an income of five thousand a-year, and
      cash to the tune of sixty thousand pounds.&rdquo; replied Nathan Gomer, with
      forcible emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; groaned Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact!&rdquo; ejaculated Gomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what magic has it been accomplished?&rdquo; inquired Grahame, apparently
      stupefied by what he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No magic at all,&rdquo; returned Nathan Gomer, grinning. &ldquo;A simple process of
      law. Years ago a near relative, named Eglinton, a connection of your own,
      gave to him an estate&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which the law took from him, exposing a trumped up&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, Mr. Grahame, be careful what you say until you have heard more.
      When our tongues run away with us, we have sometimes occasion to lament
      the want of a curb. This estate was taken from him by the Court of
      Chancery, because he failed only to produce the attesting witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush! the witness was a fiction, an imaginary person, who&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Has recently returned from India, a colonel in the East India Service, and
      sufficiently tangible to satisfy the law. This officer has not only sworn
      to the genuineness of the deed of gift, but has proved its validity, by
      giving information of the existence of a duplicate lodged by Eglinton
      himself in the hands of a solicitor long since retired from practice. This
      has been produced, attested to the satisfaction of the Chancellor, and the
      estate, together with the large arrears accumulated, are in the process of
      being restored to &ldquo;Wilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame listened in grim silence. He felt choking, with spite and
      envy. The man he had pressed to the verge of despair, in the hope to
      compel him to sign away his birthright, was now immeasurably his superior
      in position as he was his equal in descent. He would be a formidable
      antagonist to fight with the miserable deed he had forged. He could not
      dare to attempt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back in his chair with a groan. Nathan Gomer had brought him ill
      news indeed. He had expected foul tidings, yet not such as this. He could
      have wept scalding tears of bitterness, vexation, and rage. He bit his
      white and trembling lips, and exerting himself to control his tremulous
      voice, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to give me this information you have waited upon me, Mr. Gomer, I
      suppose, and with no other object?&rdquo; The misty shapes dancing before his
      eyes began to take the distinct form of a pistol with which he had
      resolved to anticipate the thunderbolt hovering over to crush him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have another object, calculated, I think, to prove vastly advantageous
      to you,&rdquo; returned Nathan, with a grin. &ldquo;You know I have your interest at
      heart,&rdquo; he grined again; &ldquo;and I wish to serve you&mdash;in my own way.&rdquo; He
      rubbed his hands, and grinned again, then he went on. &ldquo;You and Wilton are
      the claimants to the whole of old Eglinton&rsquo;s property. Wilton wants a
      witness&mdash;you want&mdash;Wilton dead&mdash;hem! All this time, neither
      of you are deriving any benefit from the property. Now supposing you and
      Wilton were to unite your claims and possess it jointly; the sum
      accumulated in arrears is enormous, and the yearly rental largely improved
      since Eglinton&rsquo;s death, is at least thirty thousand a-year. Now, an income
      of fifteen thousand pounds sterling, with half the enormous sum in cash
      for each, would not be so bad, I conceive! The money would be doing more
      good, I suspect&mdash;administering to the comforts, the pleasures, the
      enjoyments of yourselves and respective families&mdash;than it will in
      swelling the millions already held in trust by the Court of Chancery. How
      say you, Mr. Grahame&mdash;what is your opinion of my proposition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the time Nathan Gomer was speaking, Mr. Grahame experienced a variety
      of emotions. He was cold and hot by turns&mdash;now his knees quivered,
      and his teeth chattered&mdash;anon he burnt as if scorched by fever. What
      burst of sunshine was this on a heart almost buried in a dense,
      life-destroying gloom? What sudden saving hand was this lifting him up out
      of the engulph-ing quicksands of almost fathomless debt, and placing him
      upon a rock firm enough to stand the shock of any storm? What haven of
      safety was this stretching out its unassailable arms to receive him into
      its secure shelter, even while sinking beneath the hurricane raging around
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he hear aright? Had Nathan Gomer come hither only to taunt him? The
      gold-faced dwarf, albeit he grinned, seemed to be perfectly earnest and
      sincere in his proposition, and had, no doubt, good grounds for making it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck Grahame suddenly that Wilton had, perhaps, ascertained that his
      chance of obtaining any of the property beyond what he had recovered, was
      hopeless, and, therefore, now sought by a stratagem to secure half. If
      this were the fact, there was nothing to bar Grahame&rsquo;s claim to all, and
      the splendid income, with the immense sum in ready cash, roused his
      avarice&mdash;it dazzled his vision. Not a farthing should Wilton have, if
      he could obtain all&mdash;all. What a grand thing it would be to possess
      himself of all! He did not observe how keenly Nathan was perusing his
      features, nor conceive with what skilled eyes he read in their changing
      expression the thoughts which were passing through his mind. He little
      thought how bare his base greed lay before the man from whom, of all
      others, he would have most concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause purposely made by him to reduce his tone of voice and his
      manner to an attitude of perfect calm, he said to Nathan&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Wilton of course suggested this proposition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not even dream of it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;On the contrary, he is
      most sanguine of shortly discovering the witness who can prove the
      validity of his mother&rsquo;s marriage with his father. Certainly his chances
      of doing so are such as to bar any other claim to the property, until it
      is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that all his efforts have
      hopelessly failed. In the meantime, you have heavy liabilities approaching
      maturity. You best know what resources you possess to meet them, and if
      they are not unquestionable and beyond the reach of casualties, it seems
      to me you ought to leap with gladness at the chance of suddenly acquiring
      the wealth my suggestion would place within your reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame thought for a moment; his present position was very ugly;
      still he could not bring himself to think a proposition so extraordinary
      as this would be made to him unless his chances of obtaining the property
      had, in some manner unknown to himself, materially improved. Now if he
      could elicit this, he would not, for an instant, hesitate to decline to
      accede to the terms, and with this object he commenced to cross-examine
      Nathan Gomer; but before he had completed a sentence a servant entered
      with a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame recognised the superscription as his lawyer&rsquo;s handwriting, and
      saying to Gomer hastily&mdash;&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he tore it open, and read its
      contents. They were to inform him that the managing clerk of the firm
      having returned, it was ascertained that he had not had the deed; it must,
      therefore, be unfortunately mislaid. Mr. Grahame was assured that prompt
      steps would be taken to recover it, but if they failed, the usual course
      to discover any article of importance, missing or stolen, would be adopted
      without the least loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame was aghast at this information. That the deed was lost or
      stolen was clear. In either case, his position was painfully embarrassing.
      The proposal of Nathan Gomer was, therefore, a harbour of refuge to be
      secured instanter to be secured at all; so he turned to him, and said,
      quickly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reason have you to suppose that Wilton will meet your views, if he
      is in the position in this affair which you declare him to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unnecessary to give my reason. Will you have an interview with him
      upon the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;readily! When shall it take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This minute, if you will. I know that he is at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is so sudden that&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly imagine the possession of fifteen thousand a-year can occur too
      soon for your peace and safety, Mr. Grahame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead on, sir. I will accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within five minutes from that time, Nathan Gomer and Mr. Grahame were
      ushered into Mr. Wilton&rsquo;s library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The persecutor and the persecuted stood face to face.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f Flora Wilton&rsquo;s
      lovely countenance had so remarkable an effect upon the Duke of St.
      Allborne, and specially upon the heart of the Honorable Lester Vane, it is
      very certain that the persons of those gentlemen made no such impression
      either upon Flora or even Lotte. Both were so embarrassed at their sudden
      intrusion, as it appeared, upon the privacy of the party in the adjoining
      garden, that they hurried away without taking particular notice of the
      individuals composing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But both Flora and Lotte had a floating impression that one of the
      gentlemen there had large, deep, dark eyes; and that he used them too
      unreservedly and unscrupulously. Flora had also an idea of a fair, young,
      gentle face, the soft eyes of which regarded her with tenderness and
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this, nothing was retained in their minds of the persons they had
      encountered. Flora only laughingly suggested that she should scarcely
      attempt again to observe her neighbour&rsquo;s garden from that point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both girls had quite overlooked Malcolm Grahame; but if the Duke and
      Lester Vane were struck by the beauty of Flora&rsquo;s face, so was Malcolm by
      that of Lotte. It was precisely of that order of prettiness which
      especially commended itself to his taste. Selfish and proud as his mother,
      silly and conceited too, there was not much space in his heart for
      affection; nevertheless, passion occupied a tolerably large space, and the
      gratification of it was a first consideration with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his eyes Lotte was the &ldquo;prettiest&rdquo; girl he had yet seen, and to call
      the prettiest girl in the kingdom his was an ambition. He did not count
      the cost even to the poor girl who was to be captured and wear his chains.
      He had found satins and jewels, and golden gifts achieve wonders; he
      believed there was no limit to their efficacy in conquering a woman&rsquo;s
      scruples, and he had the strongest possible conviction that, if employed
      without reserve or hesitation, the most severely rigid propriety would
      succumb to their influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be smitten with the face of Lotte was to desire to obtain her. He
      viewed it as a question of time and money, and he made a memorandum in his
      note-book to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotte, thus favoured by his admiration and his intentions, had not
      observed him; if she had, she would have forgotten him immediately
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; her thoughts were employed upon the future. Under the care and
      kindness of Flora, she had in one short week won back more strength and
      health than she would have done in a month under the roof of Mrs. Bantom,
      or such an one as she could herself afford. It must be remembered, too,
      that her mind was at peace in respect to the present, and hopeful as
      regarded the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      One week longer she decided to stay beneath the roof of her good friend,
      and then into the world again, that she might eat the bread for which her
      own hands had laboured successfully. It was in vain that Flora endeavoured
      to change her determination; her self-dependent nature and free spirit
      recoiled from being indebted even to Flora for a home. So long as she had
      strength to work, and was able to obtain it, she would support herself
      until she became the wife of the man she had yet to see and love, and then
      if able to keep her, she would accept the luxury the wedded state might
      afford her; if not, they would work together, and together win a living
      for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not refuse to accept from Flora a complete stock of clothes, nor
      the loan of a small sum of money to start with, nor did she ridiculously
      refuse her profferred assistance in procuring an apartment in a
      respectable dwelling; nor when Flora urged upon her to employ her
      abilities upon some description of needlework less slavish and better paid
      than cap-front making, did she refuse to make the effort, or hesitate to
      accept work from a juvenile clothing warehouse, obtained through the
      influence of Flora&rsquo;s new dressmaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her spirit of independence was neither fastidious nor affected; it was
      genuine, sincere, and directed her along a path that, while by her open,
      ingenuous, cheerful, loving disposition, she gained the affection of all
      who knew her, she commanded their respect by eschewing all obligations
      calculated to fetter her freedom of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malcolm Grahame, during the last few days of his stay, had contrived to
      ascertain her name, and the information that she was a humble friend of
      Miss Wilton&rsquo;s&mdash;a communication he received with great satisfaction,
      because it intimated that she was poor. To be poor was to be accessible to
      temptation, and he resolved to use gold profusely to gain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He little thought while making this ignoble calculation, that he himself
      stood on the very brink of a degraded beggary. Lotte was poor, but her
      poverty had no blur of dishonour upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of her walking alone in the garden several times, and
      rushed to an upper window to waft a kiss <i>viâ</i> his fingers to her, or
      to lay his hand upon the left side of a rather narrow chest, or to render
      himself conspicuously ridiculous in other ways. His vagaries were
      uselessly performed and expended without result, for Lotte did not once
      perceive him, and left the roof of Flora Wilton, in the Regent&rsquo;s Park,
      without knowing, or desiring to know, that any such vain heartless coxcomb
      as Malcolm Grahame was in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview between old Wilton and Grahame was brief; on the side of the
      former; it was conducted with cold dignity, and on the latter&mdash;after
      two or three revelations were made which yet further opened his eyes to
      the tremendous character of the gulf, on the verge of which he had stood
      with so slippery a footing&mdash;with an oily obsequiousness which was
      contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Gomer conducted the whole proceedings, and displayed an influence
      over Wilton, the more extraordinary as it was evidently not obtained at
      the price of pecuniary obligations. The preliminaries were all arranged,
      Mr. Grahame consenting to terms which gave him the enjoyment of half the
      property and surplus funds in trust, until the claim of Wilton was fully
      substantiated, when Mr. Grahame was to resign his half, and enter upon
      arrangements by which he would gradually restore to the estate the sums he
      had received from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement was far from being a satisfactory one to Grahame, but his
      position was that of a drowning man, and, therefore, he was only too glad
      to seize anything that floated within his reach, by which he might support
      himself for a time, if not save himself altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      A memorandum was drawn up by Nathan, who grinned as he composed it,
      grinned as Grahame signed it, and grinned yet more when he appended his
      name as a witness to it. He even laughed a fat, chuckling laugh as he drew
      Grahame&rsquo;s attention to the fact, that the sheet of paper, upon which the
      memorandum was executed, bore the proper stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Grahame&rsquo;s turn to smile when, throwing a cold doubt upon the
      realisation of the estates to be thus divided, Gomer laconically requested
      him to furnish him with a list of his most pressing engagements, and he
      would at once liquidate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some thousands lying idle at my bankers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may as well
      realize a slightly better percentage from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the security?&rdquo; questioned Grahame, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require nothing more than your acknowledgment of the amounts advanced,
      and your copy of this memorandum,&rdquo; replied Gomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grahame assented delightedly, and would have taken the most affectionate
      farewell of both Wilton and Nathan Gomer, but that the former coldly
      repelled him, and the latter grinned in his face in a manner so strangely
      impish that he involuntarily shuddered, and hastened away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he descended the stairs, he encountered Flora Wilton, just as she was
      entering her favourite sitting-room, a small one overlooking the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started as he caught sight of her upturned face, and turning to Nathan
      Gomer, who was following him, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wilton, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nathan nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strikingly beautiful!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Pray introduce me,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gomer did so briefly, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will soon have the opportunity of knowing each other better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, Mr. Gomer,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, in his grandest manner, &ldquo;I
      shall look forward with impatience for that honour, I need not add, and
      high gratification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora could only look timidly from one to the other, and feel extremely
      relieved by the absence of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Gomer having, ere they parted, reiterated his promise of supplying
      Mr. Grahame with all the funds his present need required, that gentleman
      walked into his mansion with the cold loftiness of a Sultan, and with high
      elation of spirits. Not that the latter emotion rendered him cheerful; on
      the contrary, it expanded and inflated his pride&mdash;it made him look
      over to the verge of the horizon, and believe the lands and domains
      between were his own. It made him regard his servants as serfs, his
      tradespeople as vassals, his acquaintances as persons who lived only to
      bask in the sunshine of his smiles, himself an imperial personage, to whom
      it was the duty of the world in general to bow down and worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last ten days, he had felt rather disposed to sneak out of
      sight than to exhibit his greatness to wondering eyes. Now, removed from
      the danger of imminent disgrace, his own grand staircase appeared too
      circumscribed for the majesty of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whelks, who had&mdash;by hot lotions and cold lotions, and fomentations,
      and blistering garlic, new flannel, a couple of calomel pills, and a
      half-a-pint of black draught&mdash;subdued the ear-ache, lost a sovereign&mdash;how,
      he was mystified in imagining&mdash;and taken the form of a ghostly shadow&mdash;noticed
      the change in his master, but with infinitely less surprise than that
      alteration which made him almost familiar with Chewkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the instinctive perception of individuals of his class, he presumed,
      by the ascendancy of the commission agent, that &ldquo;something was up.&rdquo; He was
      extremely anxious to find out what: hence, his civility to Chewkle, and
      his desire to form an acquaintance with him. Whatever that something was,
      it was plain, by his master&rsquo;s resumption of stern pomposity that it was
      &ldquo;down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame, preceded by Whelks, entered the room in which he expected to
      find Mrs. Grahame and one at least of her daughters, but the whole family
      as well as the two guests, who had been prevailed to extend their visit
      beyond the term originally intended, were assembled together, engaged in
      conversation, which did not pause for an instant at the appearance of Mr.
      Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be pawsible, Lady Mawgawet,&rdquo; exclaimed the young Duke, addressing
      Miss Margaret Grahame, using the prefix &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; as he said in
      &ldquo;playfulness,&rdquo; &ldquo;that you did not considaw that that young cweachaw
      wejoices in one of the fawest, divinest faces, ever pwesented by the wosy
      goddess Beauty to one of youaw chawming sex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely noticed the person,&rdquo; returned Margaret, in a cold,
      supercilious tone, bending her half-closed eyes upon a magnificently
      jewelled bracelet, clasping her fat white arm, which she placed in various
      positions to study the effect of the ornament, and to admire trinket and
      arm together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked up at the Duke with a quick action and a glittering eye. She
      said in a slightly petulant tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wax dolls have the &lsquo;fairest, divinest faces,&rsquo; my lord Duke, yet we do not
      fall into raptures with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>we</i>, assuredly Miss Grahame,&rdquo; observed Lester Vane, slowly,
      &ldquo;but little children do. In their eyes dolls&rsquo; faces possess immense
      attractions, and they have a title to be ranked as the best judges of
      beauty in dolls, as&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and looked into Helen&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As men lay claim to be of loveliness in woman,&rdquo; she responded, with a
      scarcely perceptible sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As, indeed, they ought to be,&rdquo; he rejoined, quickly; &ldquo;else why are your
      sex so desirous to obtain the approving admiration of ours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fallacy, which your sex has the impertinence to assert, and the fatuity
      to believe,&rdquo; she responded with a curling lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shrewd imbecility, nevertheless,&rdquo; returned Vane, smiling meaningly.
      &ldquo;What say you, Miss Evangeline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I think she had the sweetest face I ever beheld!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Evangeline, with an enthusiasm which afflicted Mrs. Grahame&mdash;if that
      lady permitted any emotion, residing soberly within her well-ordered
      frame, to agitate itself to the extent of affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; cried Malcolm, &ldquo;you like dolls, even now. The fact is, you are all
      at fault; the companion was the prettiest of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, haw maid?&rdquo; inquired the Duke, extending his eyebrows half way up
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, her friend. I have seen them arm in arm. None of you looked at her
      face; I did&mdash;she had the prettiest in Christendom, St. Allborne, all
      the world to nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I, without inadvertence, inquire whose merits you are discussing?&rdquo;
       inquired Mr. Grahame, with a loftiness he had for some time not displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been listening in pain and astonishment,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Grahame;
      &ldquo;the subject is some creature who suddenly intruded herself upon your
      family and your guests in your garden, Mr. Grahame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intruded herself in my garden!&rdquo; exclaimed &lsquo;Mr. Grahame, in a tone of
      outraged dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His grace, perhaps, will repeat the romantic story?&rdquo; added Mrs. Grahame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, weadily, weadily! you are wight, madam, the stowy is womantic,&rdquo;
       returned the Duke, with vivacity. &ldquo;The fact is, my deaw host,&rdquo; continued
      he, &ldquo;we weaw all in the gawden the othaw mawning; we had awested owaw
      steps for a few seconds, when, all of a moment, an appawition of angelic
      beauty pwesented itself to owaw dazzled eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my garden!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, fiercely, as much as to say, &ldquo;how
      dare apparitions of angelic beauty present themselves in <i>my</i>
      garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the Duke, &ldquo;in the next gawden to the left. She wemained but
      faw an instant, and then dis-appeawed. We aw divided in opinion with
      wespect to haw chawms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manner of Mr. Grahame in a moment strangely altered its character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady is exquisitely beautiful!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with an emphasis
      which made Mrs. Grahame slowly elongate upwards and Margaret Claverhouse
      open her eyes to their full extent, while the others looked at him with
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mrs. Grahame found a tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have hardly conceived that such a person had attracted the
      notice of Claver&rsquo;se Grahame!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a tone of contemptuous
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just returned from a visit to the young lady&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; he
      returned, sharply stung by the tone of his wife&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grahame knew not how to support this dreadful wound to her pride; her
      upper lip trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Grahame,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have you been seized by the weakness of
      toadying to some man, some person, some mushroom trader, because he has
      been able to make a little parade by successful plunder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Mistress Grahame,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grahame, with imperious grandeur.
      &ldquo;Before you suffer yourself to be betrayed into any observation you may be
      disposed hereafter to recall, let me inform you that Mr. Wilton, the
      father of the young lady of whom you appear to speak and think so
      slightingly, is a gentleman possessing twenty thousand a year, and cash to
      the extent of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation burst from the lips of all present. Mrs. Grahame felt that
      she had been premature. How Margaret began to hate Flora!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me add,&rdquo; continued Mr. Grahame, &ldquo;that Mr. Wilton can claim an older
      and a nobler descent than either you, madam, or myself. In his veins runs
      the blood of the Stuarts, the Eglintons, the Grahames, and the Gordons.
      When, therefore, you apply the epithets of &lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;person&rsquo; to him, you
      injuriously insult a gentleman entitled to your highest consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ought to have added, also, for the &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; of his proud lady&mdash;&ldquo;A
      short time back he was a pauper whom I sued and thrust into prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grahame was sure now she had been premature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret hated Flora more than ever. She had despised her before; she
      feared her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weally,&rdquo; cried the Duke, &ldquo;this is a twuly bwilliant <i>dénouement</i> to
      owaw womance. Gwahame, you must pawsitively intwoduce me to that
      delightful young lady. Miss&mdash;what is haw name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilton,&rdquo; responded Grahame; &ldquo;Mrs. Grahame will probably make a visit to
      Miss Wilton, and introduce the young ladies. Miss Wilton, I have no doubt,
      will be induced to return the visit. This, as a matter of course. Our
      families are, though distantly, related. Mr. Wilton descends from the
      elder branch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have the greatest pleasure in paying a visit to this pearl of
      beauty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grahame, with an animation quite unusual to her. &ldquo;I
      regret my hasty observations, but who could have dreamed that our next
      neighbour was of such distinguished birth and position; and a relative
      too? I will not defer my visit, and taking advantage of the relationship,
      waive a portion of that ceremony I consider it essential in other cases to
      observe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I shall have, too, an introduction to this &lsquo;pearl of beauty,&rsquo;&rdquo; thought
      Lester Vane; &ldquo;it will save me a world of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not go with you when you pay your first visit to Miss Wilton, dear
      mamma?&rdquo; asked Evangeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; muttered Margaret, contemptuously; &ldquo;mamma will go alone; I shall
      not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grahame frowned; his wife caught the expression of his face, and in a
      tone which her daughters all knew was intended to silence opposition, she
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen and Margaret will accompany me; they will exert themselves to win
      the favourable opinion of their relative&mdash;attracting her to visit us
      by their cheerful smiles, rather than repelling her by any formal
      frigidity. You, Evangeline, who set all the rules of propriety at
      defiance, must remain at home, or you will only commit yourself in some
      such manner as heroines do in novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I ought to accompany you, madam?&rdquo; exclaimed Malcolm, with
      a strong impression that he should get an opportunity of exchanging looks
      and words with Lotte. &ldquo;I think the visit will hardly be <i>en règle</i>,
      without my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly struck Mr. Grahame that a match between Malcolm and Flora
      Wilton would, in all respects, be most desirable. The young lady possessed
      a long line of ancestry, wealth, and beauty. What more could a man desire
      in a wife? A marriage, too, would end the conflicting interests of both
      parties. He did not doubt for a moment, that Wilton would gladly embrace
      the advantages offered by such a plan, and he, therefore, almost looked
      upon it as being accomplished, his own future peace being secured by the
      arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to him that Flora might object, or Malcolm offer any
      opposition. He looked upon marriage as a contract, in which it was the
      parent&rsquo;s duty to secure for their children eligible matches, and for the
      children to unhesitatingly complete them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was immediately, therefore, anxious that Malcolm should accompany his
      mother, and his suggestion took the shape of a command. No one but himself
      had any inkling of his project, but though some little surprise was
      manifested, no remark was made or objection raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the visit was not to be paid until the next morning, the subject was
      here changed, and Lester Vane, as before, addressed his attentions almost
      exclusively to Helen. He rarely spoke to her without conveying a meaning
      beyond the apparent import of his words. He omitted no opportunity, either
      by word or glance, to induce her to believe that he was fascinated by her
      personal attractions and charmed by the graces of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself as much in his way as possible, whether in the presence
      of her family or alone, and she exerted all her powers to enslave him. She
      was by turns full of fire and life, seemingly gratified by his presence;
      anon, cold and pettish. She would laugh with him, and frown at him,
      display interest in what he said or did when he appeared least to desire
      to chain her attention, and seem most provokingly indifferent when he
      wished her to listen to him heedfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of all, when alone, did she play with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, by some tenderness of manner, he would be induced to commence
      acknowledgments warmer than those warranted by friendship, she would parry
      his observations, turn them to ridicule, or give to them an interpretation
      they were never intended to bear: so that he would trust only to his
      expressive eyes to say what she refused to hear his tongue utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could tell by her drooping lid and rising blush that she comprehended
      that language, and that if she would defiantly encounter his gaze, she
      must read it and interpret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves me,&rdquo; he would say to himself, &ldquo;and she must be mine&mdash;under
      what contract circumstances must alone decide for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That decision was arrived at when he heard that Flora Wilton was well born
      and rich&mdash;his hand should be for her, his passion for Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to make calculations based on probabilities, but when
      contingencies are left out, the result mostly takes a very different form
      to that which it first promised to assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had carefully watched his countenance while her father spoke of
      Flora Wilton; she had not forgotten how his eyes seemed to gloat on her
      beauty when he beheld her in the garden, and she felt convinced by the
      expression which passed over his features when he learned that Miss Wilton
      was of good birth and rich, that he then formed designs respecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush of indignation and mortification passed through her frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring him to my feet, and spurn him yet!&rdquo; she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this spirit they were all but toying with each other, when
      Malcolm, who had been reading the <i>Times</i>, uttered an exclamation,
      and, turning to his father, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember young Riversdale, sir?&mdash;you do, Helen, of course,&rdquo; he
      cried, turning to his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had fame&mdash;life&mdash;depended upon an unchanged countenance, she must
      have lost both. She on the instant grew deathly pale; she could not reply&mdash;she
      merely bent her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son of Major Riversdale,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grahame; &ldquo;I think we met them in
      the north?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Malcolm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I remember; his father died a beggar, and his uncle, an East India
      merchant, took charge of him&mdash;made him a clerk, or something of that
      kind,&rdquo; observed Mr. Grahame&mdash;&ldquo;a person one could not notice now. Why
      did you introduce his name to our notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a paragraph about him in the <i>Times</i>. It is rather a strange
      affair, I&rsquo;ll read it out,&rdquo; replied Malcolm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen held her breath. She felt that some dreadful disclosure was about to
      be made, which would overwhelm her, too. Oh, that she might not faint! If
      only she did not faint, and could get to her room, to wrestle with the
      trial&mdash;for such it must be&mdash;alone! She sat with closed hands,
      teeth, her eyes only open, motionless as a statue. Malcolm turned his eyes
      upon the journal he held in his hand, and, in a loud, clear voice, read as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A singular circumstance attended the departure from these shores of the
      Peninsula and Oriental Steam Company&rsquo;s ship, the &lsquo;Ripon,&rsquo; bearing the
      mails for India and China. When off the Needles, a young gentleman, whose
      name was ascertained to be Mr. Hugh Riversdale, was observed to be
      regarding the receding cliffs of England with deep emotion. Suddenly,
      uttering a loud cry, said by some who heard it to be the name of a lady,
      he sprang on to the taffrail of the ship, and leaped into the sea.
      Fortunately, a pilot-boat was standing off and on, waiting the arrival of
      an American liner. Her crew had observed the suicidal act, and made most
      noble efforts to rescue the young gentleman. Their exertions were, we are
      happy to say, so far crowned with success that they picked up the body in
      a lifeless state. Meanwhile, the engines of the &lsquo;Ripon,&rsquo; under the
      thrilling cry of &lsquo;a man overboard,&rsquo; had been stopped and reversed, and the
      crew of the pilot-boat were thus enabled to convey the body on board the
      steam-ship&mdash;the most advisable course to be pursued, as the best
      medical assistance, with ready access to restoratives, could be there
      promptly afforded. We are unable to state whether the exertions to restore
      life were successful, as on the recovery of the body the engines of the
      steamer were set in motion. The crew of the pilot-boat returned to their
      vessel, and the Ripon, at race-horse speed, proceeded on her distant
      voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather strange affair that!&rdquo; concluded Malcolm, laying down the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vewy womantic! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed the young Duke. &ldquo;Pwepostewous folly that,
      to dwown oneself for love! Ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly they were all startled by a terrified cry bursting from the lips
      of Evangeline. She sprang from her seat, and twined her arms round her
      eldest sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen! Helen!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;Helen, dearest Helen, you are ill, darling!
      Speak, Helen! Speak, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! Oh, mamma, mamma, pray come to
      Helen; she is dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sat erect, still, rigid as a stone statue and as lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had listened in a state of high-wrought feeling to the reading of the
      paragraph up to a certain point. She heard the description of Hugh&rsquo;s
      emotion at the sight of the diminishing heights of the land containing all
      that he loved or prized. She knew that her form&mdash;her averted form was
      at that instant before his humid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard his despairing call upon her name; she saw him suddenly spring
      up upon the vessel&rsquo;s edge, and leap out with a wild cry, plunging down,
      down into the dreadful depths of the surging sea, to find that peaceful
      release from intense mental anguish which she had selfishly and
      heartlessly denied to him here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all was dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat motionless, stark, corpse-like, consciousness departing from her,
      and leaving her without sense or motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Grahame were disturbed at the undignified departure from the
      proprieties of life displayed by both Helen and Evangeline. Mrs. Grahame
      especially was grieved to think that the example of icy immobility set on
      all occasions by Margaret Claverhouse was not followed by both her
      sisters. The bell was rung violently by Malcolm, who, except Evangeline,
      displayed the most feeling of the family. Chayter was summoned, and Helen,
      accompanied by Evangeline, was borne to her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester Vane retired to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding his arms, he paced the sinuous paths thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the mystery is solved. This youth, Hugh Riversdale,
      was my assailant in the alcove, and Helen was his companion there. Hem!
      His merchant uncle has despatched his clerk to India. He, out of his
      love-sick grief, like a mad fool, leaps into the sea, and she swoons to
      hear of his folly. She is selfish; but she loves him and seeks to fool me.
      &rsquo;Um! He struck me&mdash;this clerk. Well, she shall avenge the
      blow: away with thoughts of marriage! No; Miss Wilton, young, exquisitely
      lovely, of proud descent, and great wealth, she shall be my bride; while
      you, Helen, you&mdash;&rsquo;um! we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned upon the slight iron rail which ran along the end of the garden,
      and gazed thoughtfully into the depths of the flowing stream running
      soundlessly by.
    </p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
